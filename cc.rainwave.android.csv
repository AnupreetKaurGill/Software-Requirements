Shizune Hakamichi,Does not work,1,com.flashsphere.rainwaveplayer
Chris Miles,The app recently stopped connecting consistently to the server and now endlessly buffers. It's connectivity is incredibly spotty and I've had to resort to listening to Rainwave on Chrome app. I've been using Rainwave app for over a year without issue till now. Everything is up to date. Not sure what the issue is.,2,com.flashsphere.rainwaveplayer
Michael Barry,"Its a good little music app, actually. Ive often found myself using it to listen to chiptunes on my Amazon Echo. Thing is, for whatever reason, it doesnt connect on my phone at all, ever. Its aleays a connection error. I have an LG V20 and im using wi-fi.",2,com.flashsphere.rainwaveplayer
Nieves Mares,"It kinda works"" need support and updates. some music stays on cool down for 3-4 days and don't refresh it self automatically after picking music. Any suggestions???",3,com.flashsphere.rainwaveplayer
Matt Kell,Great for finding a variety of video game music. It is my default for music while I work. Only downside is the cast button hasn't worked for me in quite some time. Fortunately Google Home app mirror phone allows me to cast to my speakers. EDIT: I emailed the developer and the casting issue is fixed now. A status message also now let's me know when it is just connecting or buffering between my phone and the speaker.,4,com.flashsphere.rainwaveplayer
Olivier Pinsolle,"Awesome! I just wish there was a player in the notification area, as going back to the app everytine I want to pause or add favorites is annoying. With that it would be 5 stars.",4,com.flashsphere.rainwaveplayer
OneMan NoName,"Great app for VGM, but Chromecast support is not working for me.",4,com.flashsphere.rainwaveplayer
Uncle Snail,"It is great to have the availability to listen to a premixed selection of video game music. The app works well, without issues, and is well-designed.",4,com.flashsphere.rainwaveplayer

edward rivas,"Honestly I didn't expect this app to work or be as good as it is. I just 
kinda stumbled onto it online and decided to try their app for while I'm on

soundtracks I never would've otherwise.",5,com.flashsphere.rainwaveplayer

jurriaan schols,"I love the app! I love game music and the request system is awesome! If you requested a song on a long ""cooldown"" it will wait for you to come back online so you can still enjoy the request :D a true recommendation to all game lovers.",5,com.flashsphere.rainwaveplayer
Chris Zammit,Thank you thank you thank you!!! I have wanted an app that does EXACTLY THIS for YEARS. This app is perfect and does what it needs to and isn't bloated and doesn't have ads and I could hug you. I will use this app constantly.,5,com.flashsphere.rainwaveplayer
Jamie Darnell,Great app for enjoying video game music.,5,com.flashsphere.rainwaveplayer
JD Mills,"This app is amazing. Would you consider adding Android Auto support? There are dozens of us! Dozens! EDIT: it works! It would be nice to be able to see my request queue, or at least clear and refill the queue with favorites/random songs, just like the smart phone and web interfaces allow. Android auto seems to disallow interactivity almost by design, so I'm not sure if this is technically possible. Maybe it's a safety thing. I'm really grateful for the addition, though. Thank you so much.",5,com.flashsphere.rainwaveplayer
Matthew Alley,One of the bests apps I've ever used. Does exactly what I wanted/needed. The perfect replacement for DI's missing chiptune station.,5,com.flashsphere.rainwaveplayer
A Google user,"This app gives you almost all the power you have on the full website, and it does so with a simple, smooth, and reliable interface.  A few small recommendations: it would be better if the rate-a-song prompt were somehow designed so that one's finger didn't block the star rating he or she wanted to give.  Also, it would be nice to see one or more ""previously played"" songs such that one can rate a song once it's over rather than in the middle.  These are only minor flaws in an overall excellent app.  Thanks!",5,com.flashsphere.rainwaveplayer
Nostalgia Ninja,The app works better than the previous rainwave app that required an companion app.  Would love to see the current song name on the lock screen after waking the phone up from sleep.,5,com.flashsphere.rainwaveplayer
Naman Aggarwal,Thanks for this,5,com.flashsphere.rainwaveplayer
Rob McAuley,"I created Rainwave and I use this app! Keeps updated with the latest site features, and makes it much faster than our website can be on mobile browsers!  Truly excellent work. Keep it up!",5,com.flashsphere.rainwaveplayer

Elle Mitchell,"Had no choice but to finally uninstall. Locks up Pixel 4a 5G during powering on or restart (""SomaFM not responding"" prompt with options to either ""Wait"" or ""Close app""), the only non-system app to do so. Not sure why this app is continually active even when I haven't opened it. Not only that but prompt will pop up again even if I think I've killed the app. Android 12 already starting up better without it. Zero reason for this app to activate at boot up or run in the background.",1,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
Mat D,Plays for a few seconds then shuts off. Every station.,1,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm

Richy Ram,"12/23: Can't turn off...after stopping can't close app, song keeps playing, always have to restart phone (Moto G Fast) 12/28: still doesn't turn off; have to restart phone every time!!!",2,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
Marquis Von Lion,"hmm, I like soma fm but the app seems buggy, it freezes and won't turned off. Is there a fix for theses issues?",2,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
Don Teeter,I love that I can get SomaFM on a mobile device. I like the design very much. But I am amending my review to report that a) it doesn't stop playing when you pull the cord or turn off the BT device like all other music players do and b) it can become nonresponsive while playing and I have no way to kill it. I have ver 1.8.1. Update. Uninstalled. I can't have a music app that won't pause or close.,3,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
Jeffrey Benner,"Ever since last update visualization no longer works, and artist /track /album metadata no longer displays. Thanks devs I am sure you will have a fix in soon.",3,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
Felix Sears,"Works great while using phone, but most times that i lock the screen, the music stops playing after a few seconds. The lock screen controls don't do anything when that happens.",3,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
Kean Kennedy,One major issue - on my Galaxy doesn't respond to commands to stop from headphones or lock screen. You have to do it from the notification pane or app itself. Everything else is fine.,3,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
Leroy B,"Was good, no longer able to start app. It just crashes.",3,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
brian mey,Recently it's been lagging and not playing through my Bluetooth device. Please fix the issue,3,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
Jeremy,"Have been a SomaFM listener since the early 2000s and love these stations more than any other. This app is a *wonderful* way to access and stream somaFM, and I give it nearly 5 stars for ease of use, reliability, quality. The missing final star is because when you stop playback/quit the app, the next time you toggle Bluetooth on your device, this app begins playing and doesn't want to stop. Controls for the app vanish from Android and don't come back unless you restart radioOMG.",4,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
Eric Parks,"I like this app I think it's fantastic. I love being able to choose quality. The only reason I don't love it is because it's louder out of vlc. Also, the visualizer... Can we get.... a better one.....? Most folks who would use a visualizer have a screen that can do one right. 60+ fps color change with multi touch interactions.... -=cough-= milk..... Thank you for your work, and reading this if you did!",4,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
Aaron Wright,"I've been listening to SomaFM since 2006 and am so happy they've kept it going and current with technology. I used to have an iOS device and the Soma app worked very well. Android had no official app at first, but now we have this one, which is great with one exception. The stream stops after a few minutes while connected via Bluetooth with the screen locked. I have to unlock the screen to get the stream working again.",4,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
Stranga Strigo,I love this app! It has drawbacks... Mostly that it doesn't like to stop. Closing usually involves the app not responding (or taking a longer to close than seems reasonable). It's not annoying enough to be a deterrent. Still more convenient than the site for phones. It runs well in the background.,4,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
Human Spida,"Good app, really like it but it's very basic. Would be nice if it autorotated with screen orientation - can't even force it with Tasker... Will give 5 stars if it autorotates in future",4,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
Bill Lukes,"Artist, song, etc displays in car via bluetooth, but not using Chromecast or within the app? Otherwise love Soma FM and the app.",4,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
Stuart McMillan,"It's great to have an app that supports SomaFM on Android in the UK, thanks guys. I also love the stream quality selector and sleep timer. My gripes are around Chromecast it is great to have, but it's less stable than other radio streams I use - it seems sensitive to my handset disconnecting from the home network for some reason, Finally can we have native Google Home/Nest integration please - i'd love to be able to just tell my smart speakers to play some Xmas in Frisko without fiddling with my phone!",4,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
Patrick Keogh,"The developer was kind enough to troubleshoot my problem. The work around, if the app takes over and locks up your phone, is to restart the app and disable visualization before playing music. After that the app works fine.",4,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
anony mous,A very good application. The only reason I gave it Four stars is the doomed station is only a special station for Halloween. I would like this station to be available all year round.,4,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
Jay S,Love SomaFM. Would give this 5 stars if it supported landscape orientation since I also use this on my tablet. Hoping landscape is supported in future versions.,4,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
David Collins,Good app but no 5 stars until there is a landscape mode. Using latest Samsung tablet which has both speakers at bottom.,4,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm

Christian Dysthe,I've been a SomaFM listener since 2001! They are still my go-to Internet radio. This app complements the service perfectly and not only works well but looks the part also. I now have SomaFM in my car through my phone with this app daily. Great work!,5,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
Peter Fanelli,"Have been listening to SomaFM for several years. What a fantastic app! Great selection of genres, always interesting, got into some music that I wasn't aware of. How cool is that!?",5,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
r winters,"BEST soma fm app, should be official but isn't (don't think they have an official app TBH). Great intuitive interface + Visualizer + ALL soma fm channels + not trying to put ads on free soma FM content (y'all should support soma FM directly, though) + ability to easily make favorite stations. Other ""radio apps"" should take notes! Fan for life here, great work!",5,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm

L Jiminez,This works on my Nvidia Shield 2015 version. However: 1. Unavailible in the Shields Play Store app. You'll have to sideload it. 2. You'll need a multimedia controller with a trackpad mapped to your TV's screen. The Logitech K830 worked for me. 3. A static image will be left on your TV screen. Prolonged use could 'burn' your TV screen. If your TV has a setting to turn the screen off use it for screen protection. Alternatively you could use an HDMI splitter (or extractor) into your audio gear.,5,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
Greig McPherson,"Amazingly simple app, it just works without issue every time. Great way to listen to any soma fm channel. Not sure what bitrate streams they use I've had it blasting out a pretty high quality Bluetooth speaker and it sounded great, but maybe a selector for stream quality would be a nice addition in future. Recommended A+",5,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
Lisa Jooste,Brilliant!! I love Soma FM but the official app was removed....this one works beautifully.,5,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
Stuart McDonald,"Have been a big listener via the web site for some time (special agent). This app is superb for me as I can now just quickly view other stations and hit play. Its so easy to use, none of the BS other music apps have. Great app guys, better than that superb A+ Forgot to say, plays the kinda stuff I'm into, lounge and exotica.",5,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
Brett Jackson,"Incredible work by the developer. Doug let me buy you a beer/coffee and or support you, bud! I'm a somafm addict and I was using Alpha player before I saw this popup on the play store. alpha player has some bugs where a stream won't start or the wrong stream will play for what's currently shown. This app works beautifully so far! I can't wait to try it on Android Auto.",5,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
Hex Machine,"Wow...after using this new, unofficial app, I don't miss the official, decommissioned SomaFM app I used for years. Good job! I love the ability to select stream quality. I wonder what new goodies are in store on this app? ***Request: the lockscreen widget does not have next song, play/pause buttons similar to Spotify-can these be added? FYI, I'm using a Pixel 4a, Android 11. Too bad SomaFM couldn't use all those donations they solicit to fund an app of this quality.",5,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
Steve Waters,"Amazing app for your somafm fix. I've been listening since about 2007 and this app is clean and simple and keeps me plugged in for my daily soundtrack. Seriously there's nothing better than playing Vaporwaves poolside or Digitalis with your morning coffee. Great and solid app build, and many kudos!",5,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
Lloyd Landis,"This listener supported radio station deserves all the love (money) because they will never let you down, only pick you up!

Scott Sanderlin,"SomaFM showcased in a neat, clean, and useful app. It offers fans of Big Url, et al, all of the stations in an astutely simple and enjoyable way. Imo, the Dev coded the app much the same as SomaFM presents the music itself. Which is too say that, the focus of the app is on SomaFM, as the focus of SomaFM is the music. Nicely done, Dev! ~ SszZ",5,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm
Cole Snyder,"Good stuff! Very simple and intuitive. I've missed sitting down to program and having Soma playing in the background. Did not ask for permissions to anything, which is big considering Soma FM's popularity in the hacking community. Haven't had an issue yet.",5,com.dgmltn.radiomg.somafm

If a stream inserts an ad at the beginning of the playlist, only the ad plays and the music stream does not.   Some stations work and then unaccountably stop and won't work again.  You can't sign into your account from the Android TV app.  Emails to support go unanswered.

I had just spent hours looking at music apps and reading their reviews.This was also after just discovering I had the desktop version of this app. installed on my laptop - from YEARS ago. I had forgotten about it, there was no shortcut for it on my desktop or any other clues. Unused is unremembered. I found it yesterday in my Downloads Folder while looking for something else. I remembered it only after the *successful download* to that above-mentioned different phone, while looking for radio stations to save as Favorites. I was surprised to find SO MANY MORE Artist Stations! Comedy Stations are about the same. I will look for more to submit. I like the banner ads option.

Karan S,"This is the first top-notch radio app I could recommend to anyone ever. Different stations, tuned to different cultures songs/news, not only that but when you take a walk at park, you never how many 80s songs you get to know in a day. It's fully functional and sounds great both technically and from customer point of view. The good thing is there is sometimes a small ad that does occur but for fewer than 5 to 8 seconds. Overall , outstanding. I send all 5 for this app!. VRadio. VICTORY",5,com.ilv.vradio
Ray Kay43,"Radio tuner of choice. Easy to navigate, with thousands of stations all over the world. Provides info on types of music preferred. Stations can be kept together as favorites regardless of world location. Ads are non intrusive but plan to pay forever to support the programmers of this app. Highly recommended. Saved me from having to buy a physical FM/AM radio set that has limited coverage. Makes sense as I can even listen to those app in my car while traveling.",5,com.ilv.vradio
Wm. Cox,"Paying user here. Best Internet Radio app I've used and I've tried many others. My only issue is that you can't replace the station logos -- most are pretty ugly and not ideally sized for the app's button format. I've found a work-around, though; just enter the station's streaming URL and create your own user station. Then you can add your own image. Like a lot of work-arounds, this takes extra time and effort. But it's so worth it to have well-organized and cool looking station lists. Please consider adding this feature (unless the stations prohibit it for some reason,)",5,com.ilv.vradio
William,"if you are wanting an internet radio that's reliable and has a long list of genres plus an astonishingly complete countries menu then look no farther, you've found it; organize your search comprehensively and enjoy what you find; a treat all the way around from the search parameters, then the setting of your personal list of enjoyable favorite stations make this a satisfying experience; get it; discover for yourself.",5,com.ilv.vradio
John Smith,"A good app in general. Two places to improve to be perfect (to beat Cloud Radio), both about scheduled recordings: 1. When a recording starts, the radio shouldn't be on, as this is different from the alarm clock feature. This function is needed usually because a user cannot or doesn't want to listen to the radio at that time. Radio-on defeats the purpose. 2. if the above background recording is implemented, then multiple stations can be recorded at the same time, just as Cloud Radio can do.",5,com.ilv.vradio
Paul Brooks,"I listen to a lot of music, and a lot of musical genres. I like radio, and a lot of what I listen to is, I find on radio. In giving VRadio a try, I can already say that I am liking it very much. VRadio offers a clean, easy to navigate, interface. It comes packed with many stations and shows from all the World over, and even offers the ability to record what you listen to. In doing searches, I failed to locate certain Stations, which seem to be unavailable on VRadio at this time. So, -5 Stars.",5,com.ilv.vradio
John Walker,"Five stars don't do this app justice, nor does simply reading about it. You've GOT to try this! It is likely THE most intuitive of any app out here, regardless of type, and most certainly is tops in its category. Adding URLs for stations not already included is a breeze. Everything is fast to load, and I've yet to encounter a buffering issue. I bought the ""ad-free forever"" version, and it's worth every cent.",5,com.ilv.vradio
Istvan Helmeczy,"Best radio player and radio recorder. There are lots of setting I can use. I added new radio station that wasn't in the line up and recorded it. Saved it to my phone that I could access it from my laptop. And played the recording with different mp3 player. There are lots of stations. ""exclusive"" stations for top singer. Such as Pink, Michael Jackson, etc those only play the singer's songs. There are lots of more this can do! Someone really put in time to make this app the best.",5,com.ilv.vradio
Steve Marten,Exceptionally well put together. I love the station's I love the options to be able to record what you hear period and the ads are not really that obtrusive. And they dang sure don't make the experience not worth it. Small price to pay for such a good free app. And you have the opportunity to buy the ads away if you really just can't stand them.

Ken Busser,"EXCELLENT app, when you touch the app icon, your last station plays immediately! Love that! Choose your favorite stations, you can edit or move them to the top of the list (much like a car radio's PRESETS. It is VERY RELIABLE, has a SLEEP TIMER and a BUILT IN RECORDER.

Some have fifteen, while others have over a hundred!!!",5,com.ilv.vradio
Jonathan R,"VRadio blows away the competition, as far as I am concerned. Smooth and intuitive navigation, solid audio quality, solid and diverse content that is refreshed and updated, unobtrusive and less frequent ad interruptions, and plays nice with my somewhat limited lower-tier phone. I have tried some other big name radio apps that left me very disappointed, due to awkward or clunky navigation, weak audio quality, mediocre content, ad oversaturation, or hogging real estate on my phone. VRadio is great!",5,com.ilv.vradio
Arian_,"Absolutely the best radio app that I always come back to. The new UI looks fantastic and the ads are not intrusive at all. There is just one feature that seems to be missing and that's the ""Song Log"" feature which stores the songs that you listened to during your session. This truly is a GEM of an app. Thank you for your hard work.",5,com.ilv.vradio
Keith Monteleone,"Well curated and organized. Great to have the Exclusive Radio (individual artists) streams. Easy to use and modify for your use. Nice to have bitrate info when selecting a station and playing a station, and it also tallies total data consumed for wifi and cellular. Sure there isn't a guitar genre, but there is enough to keep me happy. Advertising is benign, but I will go no ad just to support this outstanding effort. As I've used it more, the use of the station tagging is so easy and so powerfu",5,com.ilv.vradio
Michael Turyn,"It's great being able to: 0.) Schedule multiple recordings. 1.) Keep them in their original formats, and 2.) Not interfere with other audio-using applications (if set not to grab the audio device). I particularly like now being able to set this application's volume independently of the system volumeset scheduled recordings to 'Mute', which looks as if it doesn't even reach for the audio device‚ÄîI now will listen to one station on another application whilst recording another, without interruption. (Thanks to the developer for noting my previous R.F.E.s; here's one very simple‚ÄîI'm guessing‚Äîone:) Muting a stream you've manually started recording‚ÄîI mean not scheduled in advance‚Äîwould be great.That is to say, I'd like to start a recording, mute it, and be able to listen to something else via another application, as one can if the recording was scheduled in advance with the volume set to 'Mute'.",5,com.ilv.vradio
G S,"Highly recommended! Great selection of stations, easy to use, many ways to manage the app. Great for music lovers! Tip: to make the app more pleasurable, I suggest buying the ad remover.

However, I think a more colourful playing-page would be nice, and I'd like to see a choice to auto connect to Chromecast when a Chromecast device is detected; this would be very nice. VRadio gets full marks for auto adjusting the volume level when transferring from local phone-play to Chromecast-play... excellent!

Lawrence Chitty,"When TuneIn in the UK has blocked access to most non UK radio stations, I went hunting for an alternative. After trying several app, I came across VRadio. I have never looked back. It is very well thought out and easy to use.",5,com.ilv.vradio
Noel Mathew,I've been using VRadio (the ad-free version) since quite some time now. I've recently noticed that the app starts playing stations all of a sudden without opening the screen/app even when the phone is moved while it is in screen off state.,5,com.ilv.vradio
robin simmonds,Brilliant app. Does exactly what it says on the tin. Added value is that you can record programmes to listen to off line.,5,com.ilv.vradio
Saptana E RHJ,This is the radio application what I want. uninterupted playback while another application requests audio. It can do recording and alarm. Will be much better if uswr can record by the alarm. One minus thing is the radio database need to be updated for more complete although user can add user station. unfortunately user not always know the url.,5,com.ilv.vradio
Andrew Harvey,"Excellent app - it provides rapid access to all the stations I like, enables custom stations like BBC Radio 3HD and enables casting to my . It would be great if it had two useful Audials features of (1) showing whats playing on all radio stations simultaneously in the stations list and (2) a compact widget button for playing radio stations",5,com.ilv.vradio
Peter Gordon,"So far so very good. It has a very good selection of radio stations and the recording facility works very well. Delighted. Pity about the ads. I will try it for a little longer after which time I will probably upgrade. Now, having used it for some time, I only have good things to say about it It works very well indeed. Many thanks for its development.",5,com.ilv.vradio
Ian Turner,"Great radio app, on my phone and in car unit. Background is very bright, power hungry. Adding colour change options for station name and song info. Then again for the logo background would also be helpful. Being able to change station logos would be a huge help.",5,com.ilv.vradio
paul davidson,"Great little player. Loads of stations all over the world. Easy to navigate, favorite & record. Cheap ad free options. It doesn't get much better than this.",5,com.ilv.vradio
Andre Ferchau,So far so good. Other reviews speak highly. I would like to be sure that if I am a paying user that maybe the developer could make old versions available just in case a new version breaks something. I see so many complaints often about something stop working. That would be a pity on such a great app.,5,com.ilv.vradio
Vasilis Pangratis,Listening to Greek radio abroad through the Android Auto while driving . Good enough for me!!! And the yearly subscription to avoid advertisements ( although they are not too intrusive and I was using it for free for years) is in very reasonable pricing. Keep it up guys.,5,com.ilv.vradio
Daniel F,Works well. Hundreds of stations available. It's like having satellite radio in my car (with Bluetooth). I recommend this ap!,5,com.ilv.vradio
Tom Adams,Excellent app. The easy to use scheduled record facility is a stand out feature as is the ease with which unlisted stations can be added. The ads are not intrusive but I will be purchasing the ad free version to support the app.,5,com.ilv.vradio
John Lennox,Great app with access to a vast array of radio stations covering a wide range of tastes from all over the world. Very user friendly and the quality of sound and access to stations is excellent. Best radio app I have tried. üòä,5,com.ilv.vradio
Leo Ben,"I've been using it for a month now. It's a very intuitive app, lots of world wide stations, stable performance. It costs little to get add free for life.",5,com.ilv.vradio
philip Schiemann,Love it very versatile. Tons of radio stations. Great app. Keep it up.,5,com.ilv.vradio
Cael Collum,"What a great radio app. Tons of stations, options, categorization, and even a user radio feature. I loaded about 8 in as soon as I perused the genres and other categories and decided this one's staying on my phone. Unfortunately it's missing some of the good ones like Asia Dream Radio, so I'll be keeping TuneIn for those stations. All in all the best online radio player experience I've ever had, topping even TuneIn. Get it.",5,com.ilv.vradio
Nikolaos Kagiorgis,"I use this App the last 3 years. Amazing !!! Keep up like this. This app gives access to radio all over the world and in every kind of music !!! Music connect us , thanks for this great app!",5,com.ilv.vradio
Marc Sauv√©,Excellent all around. Love the fact that you can add your own and make station suggestions.,5,com.ilv.vradio
skellon3728,"After being tunein subscriber for years, I noticed that most of the stations I listen to disappeared so I tried various radio apps and this one came up as the best. That was six months ago and i havent looked back....this is the best radio for android imho.....",5,com.ilv.vradio
Steve Woodyatt,A great range of stations to search for and listen too. Lots of different genres to choose from and a useful widget as well.,5,com.ilv.vradio
Bill Clarke,"Awesome developer. Had trouble getting the ads removed due to Google seeing two accounts on my device, and the dev responded immediately and solved the problem. App is rock solid and preferable by far compared to the bigger competitor.",5,com.ilv.vradio
Steve Raduns,Works great & sounds great! Highly Recommended! Developer is fast to respond to questions or issues. I wish I could download it from the Google Play Store for the Nvidia Shield streaming device.,5,com.ilv.vradio
Tom Tomason,"Covers the entire planet. Good, I guess. Would like to see more choices in America. The app itself is awesome.",5,com.ilv.vradio
Television Archive Studios,Best money I've ever spent on an app. Works great. Makes it so easy to find Radio Stations. The Recording feature works well. So glad to purchase an app that works this good.,5,com.ilv.vradio
Stefano Prime,"Ability to add/save/edit your own stations which aren't already listed, add artwork, a working/easy to use record function, easy on the eye visually, works flawlessly on both my mobile device & 4K fire stick - This is the perfect radio app for Android that absolutely smashes all the other ones which I've wasted my time on in the past completely out the park & this is a very easy/instant 5 stars from me! Big shout to the developers - Keep up the good work! You've done a great job with this üëç",5,com.ilv.vradio
Robert Ranyard,"Great selection stations and music,sound quality exceptional. üëå",5,com.ilv.vradio
George P.,"App keeps getting better and better, although the UI is still a bit cluttered. Please make a different version that doesn't include ads/trackers, considering that if you don't use Google Play the app displays ads no matter what since it can't connect to Google's services and confirm you've paid. edit: That's precisely why I did it, no worries. Thanks for your understanding.",5,com.ilv.vradio
Rick Grant,"It took me all of about 4 minutes to decide to buy the full advertising-free version. This is an excellent, well designed, easy to use, and powerful app. I have used a number of radio apps with my Samsung over the years and never been entirely happy, especially with those that take my data for their own purposes. Vradio is a stand-out and one of the few that allows recordings. ... Full 5 Star rating for sure. (My earlier review asked for a scheduled recording option. The app in fact includes such an option. So, how does a 6th Star sound?)",5,com.ilv.vradio
Varaloba One,"Well, what can I say, this app is outstanding, the more I use it the more I learn about it and enjoy all the options it gives. I have tried all the ""big"" names, but I think that VRadio is far better. So much thought has gone into the design, for example the favourites can be sorted so many ways, for example name, popularity, genre etc., which makes finding the right station easy, so much in in the app, search options, recording, sleep timer, equalizer, alarm clock, the list just goes on! One day ago, I emailed the developer, maybe 10 stations that I liked were not there, next day they had appeared! Whilst not a fan of subscription payments, I tend to avoid those apps, the developer has offered a reasonable ""one off"" payment, the price of a beer, which I will seriously consider once I have full tested the app, so yes, I think VRadio is one of the best - thank you.",5,com.ilv.vradio
Salih Kunduz,"This is now my go to radio app and already purchased the full version to support further development. You deserve an exclusive appreciation for also making the app 100% accessible for us visually impaired. Another feature I like is being able to play custom stations. Hence I've found some stations from countries which are not listed. I'll be happy to share them if you wish to include within the stations directory. One thing I'm missing is the amount of stations from asian and South American countries. I really enjoy going to random countries and listening to how their songs/conversations sounds like. There are more than enough radios from my country (Turkey) but if you can get more stations from countries like China, Japan, Vietnam, Chile, Peru, Honduras, Mongolia etc. That'd be great.",5,com.ilv.vradio
Konstantinos Daglaroglou,"Very good app with nice themes, great layout and very useful and functional widget. It can automatically detect the broadcasting stations in a given country and town with icons and everything, I haven't seen that in any other online radio app I tried. It also displays some stations in my city that other app were not able to detect. It does not allow data buffering adjustment and this omission can lead to playback hiccups. I think it's the best of its kind.",5,com.ilv.vradio
Guillermo Gra√±a G√≥mez,"Useful app with many great features. I installed this because I was looking for a shoutcast app to listen to my favorite music on my mobile phone while commuting, and it is easily the best one of the half-dozen or so I've tried so far. Lets me listen to dozens of radio stations from all over the world. It is stable and fast, with a clear interface and sensible menus. Well worth the 6 bucks to disable ads forever. Keep up the good work!",5,com.ilv.vradio
Bal Singh,"THE BEST RADIO APP AVAILABLE ON ANDROID. 100% worth paying for. If I could buy the Dev a drink, I would. The app is just awesome! You can adjust the size of the icons, that represent the stations. The app has user friendly searching of genres of music, locations, etc.. If you have a tablet, the user interface adapts to both landscape and portrait mode. The Dev has been kind enough to add some stations that I requested too. Quite frankly, this app is light years ahead of other radio apps. Buy it.",5,com.ilv.vradio
David Smith,"Installed on my Android phone, very impressed with the vast array of radio stations and performance of the app. Adverts aren't too intrusive yet, although I will be subscribing. Especially like the ability to add stations which aren't included in VRadio's extensive database. Only slight downside is that the app doesn't include AM stations. Great free app, thankyou!",5,com.ilv.vradio
Philipp Matzinger,"After testing many radio streaming apps, this one is a true gem. The developer put so much thought and love into it, it's feature rich and fully transparent, a rare thing in today's app world. though the interface is a bit 'geeky', without flashy buttons and stuff, that's exactly what I like. cool feature is the scheduled recording! well done!",5,com.ilv.vradio
vasos adams,"I was using tunein for years. I tried vradio for about 25 minutes and then I uninstalled tunein! Half an hour later I purchased the ""fotever subscription"". The best! The only feature missing is on lockscreen. I mean that I can see on lockscreen only the control buttons and not the station and song. Update: no problem anymore! thanks! It gets better and better!",5,com.ilv.vradio
Mark Wyler,"This is a very good app. I honestly can't think how it could be better... Its fast and light and well thought out, and just does the business. A very small UK community radio station was missing, no biggie, added it easily as a user station and it worked perfectly. So I paid for ad free not because the ads were too intrusive but just to say thanks.",5,com.ilv.vradio
Leo Hirth,"I cannot believe that there is a app like this one - Works from the first second after installing, no log-in required, seamless Android Auto experience, has all radio stations I was interested in right from the start. Recommend highly, and: People, pay for the ad-free version! No issues with ads in the car and the developer has more than deserved it.",5,com.ilv.vradio
Simon Spencer,"This app without doubt the best radio app I've ever used. Super quick to load, good quality sound, equaliser settings built in, and can even change with most stations go to aac sound quality, which is a bonus as it gives you a better sound than regular mp3 format. All stations I've tried have WORKED EFFORTLESSLY first time without fail. The developer, or developer's have really done a SPOT ON JOB with this app, thumbs up üëÜ to you. Really know what you're doing. Thanks, bye.",5,com.ilv.vradio
Stephen Ralph,I've previously used Xiia Live but now use your app because it is prectically perfect with all the features that are needed but missing from Xiia Live. There is just one small feature missing though. The sleep timer. Could you add the ability to fade to silent as the timer ends instead of an abrupt switch off of sound? That would be perfection. üòä Thanks for you excellent app. Just one other thing. Xiia Live has a progress bar so it is possible to rewind within the cache to listen again. üëèüèªüëè,5,com.ilv.vradio
Shrey Grover,"Loved it so much! Very high quality stations and with updated stations almost regularly. I can listen to them anywhere I like, no need to have an actual radio player with me anymore. Great thing is that, the app has all the radio stations from all over the world so in that case, I know which exactly I can listen to and which language. For my favourites though, I personally mostly listen to Hindi and English. But overall, it is a great app and everyone can listen to whatever they like. Thank U!üëç",5,com.ilv.vradio
Peter jones,"Finally i found a radio app which does the job without being too overenginered or too busy. Doesnt dump loads of files or folders into your system (hello Audials!) Very functional, fast with a logical layout. Im very impressed! Why cant other apps get to the point as this one does without trying to be too flashy or showing off!! Top marks fili mou !",5,com.ilv.vradio
terrorstroika,"A great app - the scheduler is particularly useful allowing recording/playback at specified times. Recommended. EDIT: In latest version, in DARK THEME can barely see the figures above clock in schedule time setting mode and they seem to be inverted in an unhelpful way. PLUS , this evening, I set a schedule for 8pm which didn't go off until 8:30pm.",5,com.ilv.vradio
J P,"Absolutely amazing radio app. Brilliant UI packed with every feature you could need. Very well thought out and presented app. Using for a few weeks now and simply the best radio app I've used! Update, after using for over 6 months not once has the app let me down. Works brilliantly over all data speeds. A joy to use with a clear well laid out UI. Still the best and only radio app I've used.",5,com.ilv.vradio
Lefteris Giotas,"Switched to this App from tunein a few months ago. I use it daily and mostly with my Chromecast audio device. The performance till now is Rock Solid!! No unexpected errors, no glitches, no problems! This app definitely delivers what promise to do! Although ads were not annoying when using the app, i've purchased the disable ads option just to give the developer a reward for his Great job! Thank you! P.S. It would be a very nice feature If playback of last station starts automatically when we push the cast button.",5,com.ilv.vradio
Nathan Hubbard,"Fantastic browser for stations, and so so many stations collected. The interface is fast/responsive and simple. Works exactly as I'd expect and want. I haven't had any bugs while listening to music (and I listen for hours at a time). I use a VPN and it still works fine. Theres also lots of functionaility packed into the simple UI. Thank you for listing station audio bitrate! And thank you for not requiring a sign-in to save favourites!",5,com.ilv.vradio
Kyle Briffa,"Excellent app. Best radio app I have found, amazed at the level of features in this app compared to others, I found everything I needed and much more. Looks really polished as well. Thank you developer! Edit: Only thing I miss is a persistent notification or a pause button instead of a stop. i sometimes want to just pause to watch something and quickly unpause it again.",5,com.ilv.vradio
P.S. Sudarsan M Sc Acupuncture,Very Best App. We can record the songs. Very user friendly. Thanks to the developer. I used free version. Now i am using paid version. Both are Good.,5,com.ilv.vradio
Gajendra Khanna,Everything I Wanted in A Radio App! It has lots of channels out of the box and It let me add some of my favourites which were missing from it. Plays and records very easily. Saves favourites. Has an easy search. It even lets you put radio alarms and schedule recordings. Best Radio App I have come across. Wish they come out with an iOS and Amazon Firetv stick version too. (Able to install via sideloading on latter but ads hang) Kudos to the team!! Fabulous effort by them deserving five stars.,5,com.ilv.vradio
Mark Anderson,"The best radio app out there! Like many others, I found this app after becoming frustrated when TuneIn starting to decrease radio stations and add many limitations. Can't fault VRadio, but as a request I would very much welcome additional information being shown when, for example, a song is being a played i.e. track name, band, etc rather than just the static radio station logo visible at all times. A small niggle for an otherwise perfect radio app.",5,com.ilv.vradio
Prakash Rapeti,"This is the finest Radio I have come across. Flaw less works solid rock. More Bhakti Radios (India) welcome. No nagging adds, is a refreshing feature. I earnestly hope to see this app for iPhone too",5,com.ilv.vradio
Gurcharan Kaur,"WOW! This is the best radio app in the world. You can cast using this app. It also has an alarm & recording feature. Sleep timer too! You can choose to have your favourite stations come up when the app starts. God bless the Dev of this app. It is truly amazing, even on my Android Headunit, in my car. You can export the fav list of stations and import them on all your devices. This radio app is just something else. If I could give 10 stars, I would. I love this radio app & highly recommend it.",5,com.ilv.vradio

Bill Madden,"Discovered VRadio recently and love it, if you can't find music to suite you here, you live on Mars. There are a few adds but you get (here in Ireland) almost continuous music with very little dropout. I also find it isn't a big drain on my battery, and it's very easy to navigate, I'm happy to give it 5 stars!",5,com.ilv.vradio
Seamus Moore,"Stations are easy to find, Not too many ads. Best so far",5,com.ilv.vradio
Jef Holdsworth,"An amazingly full-featured app. I'd give it 5 stars if only it would play at a higher volume. When sharing output from the phone speaker at full volume, VRadio is much quieter than some other apps which I use. Edit: Instant response by the developer suggested maximizing volume in the Equaliser settings . . . which worked fine. Thanks Ioannis.",5,com.ilv.vradio

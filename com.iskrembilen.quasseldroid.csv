Andrew Wright,I hate the new app. The chat list avatars don't go away even with the avatar option disabled. Also can't turn off the topics and names. These two combined make the list to spread out and really hard to scroll.,1,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Stijn Tintel,"Horrible. Buttons that appear when long pressing a network do not work, so I need to delete a network and add it again to make this thing reconnect.",1,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Auke Kok,"really disappointed that the new version doesn't highlight channels any more, which severity hinders effective use.",1,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
A Google user,Somehow the UI got even worse. I'll have to sideload from an old version now...,1,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid

Ahti Järvelä,Make it suck less,1,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Michael Carpenter,"Refuses to connect to cores connected to multiple networks once backlogs 
get beyond a certain size. Completely unusable without disabling backlogs 
entirely on the core... which defeats the purpose.",1,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Tamara Jordan,Couldn't connect to Freenode.,1,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
A Google user,Hasn't been updated in a long time (2014) and appears to break in Android N. Unfortunately it appears this is the only quassel client for Android.,1,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid

Mohammad Amin Sameti,"Does not store identities or networks. Good design, bad functionality.",2,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Reinis Ivanovs,No way to filter out joins or parts.,2,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Charles Johnson,"This ""dark"" theme which is now gray instead of black is hard to see with certain font colors, plus harder to see in general in brighter light. -2 stars until the old black theme from a couple versions ago is added back in. Moto E (2nd gen with Android 5.1)",2,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Sam Reed,Doesn't handle SSL certificate changes well. Just get stuck in a loop. Clearing data/cache didn't help... Or is it just broken on Android N?,2,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Reuben Peterkin,The version on F-Droid is newer.,2,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
A Google user,Doesn't seem to work on LTE,2,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
A Google user,When will the old black theme be available again? Gray background is rough to read in certain lighting conditions and with some font colors.,3,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Mathijs Lindeboom,App constantly crashes(and says Reporting crashes) constantly on start up. Whenever i do manage to get through it works perfectly,3,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
A Google user,"Often after the app has been running for a while, channels seem to not be reliable. Especially if I use a client on the computer in between sessions. I was very confused when I opened one channel to find a completely different one. Sometimes, the list of people who are online are off too. I've once found someone logged in under the same nick 4 times (that's a bug). Its because it doesn't seem to always register when someone quits or parts.",3,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
B Hellman,Having an auto reconnect would be helpful. Switching between network and wifi means manually reconnecting. It's a pain.,3,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Robert Wilson,Worked perfectly fine until recent update to side swiping version. The app crashes every second reconnect attempt,3,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Shaun Bouckaert,After selecting a channel the back button should take you back to the channel list. The interface needs a lot of improvement.,3,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
James Russell,Seems good. Would be great to have a full screen view that hides the status bar and the bar with the hide button.,3,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
A Google user,Cannot select text and links. Also there is no exit button and the app will run non-stop once it is started.,3,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
A Google user,"Nice when it works, but it crashes more often than not. Galaxy S2.",3,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
A Google user,"Would be sweet, logs in to core OK but just says ""loading..."" forever. Tested with 0.7.2 on arch. Looking forward to this though!",3,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Masoud Moradi,"Quassel is great on the desktop, both the server (core) and the client have been my favorites for years now. So happy to see the Android version and I like it very much. It works smoothly, nice UI, and overall a great experience; possibly one of the best IRC clients for Android.",4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Josh Rehm,"Setup isn't exactly straightforward, but seems to work well when you get it going.",4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Scott Kitterman,"Great upgrade if you're quassel-core is updated to 0.13. If not, upgrade your core first.",4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Joshua Booth,"If you are already using Quassel, this app is awesome. If you aren't, this app is probably overkill.",4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
A Google user,"Works well, though the fact that the quassel protocol is TCP/IP can be a 
bit annoying.",4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
A Google user,"Could really use the promised push notifications - that should solve all battery and connection issues (so that one can stay pretty much disconnected until a highlight or something). Otherwise a stellar app, supports pretty much everything the other native clients do.",4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Dave Chiluk,The devs really need to work on the power consumption.  This app destroys my battery.  Other than that it's really hard to give up quassel when you live and breath IRC.,4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Lucas Williams,It works way better than anything on the Apple side. Closest thing to the quassel-client on Android.,4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
A Google user,Needs push support for notifications to help save battery. For some reason I can't disable the notification icon. Other than that is a great client for Quassel Core.,4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
A Google user,"The interface is cleanly organised, and the experience has been seamless so far. Except for one thing: sending URLs and other text still requires a copy-paste. It would be great if the app can be registered with Android Intents so that text can be sent to active channels and users through the Share feature.",4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Joshua Johnston,"This is a well made application in general, and works great when you have a solid connection. But iffy connections can be very frustrating when the screen goes back to login mid-sentence. Also, highlighting should never use the same color as a username.",4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Matt Kereczman,This is a great IRC client for Andriod. The only thing I think it's lacking is an auto-reconnect option; that would make this a 5 star review.,4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Gareth Woolridge,Would be a 5 with autoreconnect.,4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Anthony Gautier,"Great app, helps me keep tabs on IRC without needing a constant connection. Would love a system for setting up notifications when certain things happen in a channel, e.g. a keyword appears. Also, a setting to remember last view when activity loses scope.",4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
David Fox,I'd give this 5 stars if one feature was added - auto reconnect. THIS IS A MUST! Other than that it's a great app!,4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Sami Liedes,"A few things I miss, in order of importance to me: The ability to select text for copying; automatically reconnecting when my phone switches to/from WLAN; and the ability to open a new query without typing /msg.",4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Louis Rossouw,We just need automatic reconnection options.  When I switch wifi or move from mobile to wifi I want it to automaticall reconnect.,4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Chuck Burns,"Just missing autoreconnect options, otherwise a great way to keep up with my IRC channels.",4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Kurin P,"Aside from some features that will probably be added later, I can't think of any downside to this app!",4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
A Google user,but its still a long way to go: any advanced inspircd support is currently missing.,4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Νίκος Κ,"Update works now for nexus 7, thanks!",4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Jason Edwards,"This app crashed on connection when I first installed it. If that happens to you, check if something else is using the same port on the host machine - in my case there was (crashplan) - changed the port quassel core uses and it stopped crashing.",4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
A Google user,Update to a previous review. I think the most important thing to work on this app now is battery life. Sleeping and polling or push options from the server. And a donate button!,4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Dana Moult,Very polished and does what it's supposed to do very well. Just needs to add a few basic features like changing channel topics and op-ing or kicking people and it would be perfect.,4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Dirk Hohndel,No update in a long time...,4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
A Google user,ok,4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
A Google user,"Worked perfectly until the last 3 updates, now it crashes a lot with null pointer exceptions. Have submitted reports.",4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
A Google user,"Invaluable, fast and stable.  One question: is there tab completion for nicknames or not? I see reference to it in the release notes but can't for the life of me work out how to do it...",4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
A Google user,"Can't join channels, and looses connection often, but great start!",4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
A Google user,"Nice start, works fine for me with core 0.7.2 Way to go!",4,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Swaraj Hota,"Says ""disconnected"". Just can't connect to the core. Works perfectly on the desktop client but don't know what's the problem with android client. Can't find any help whatsoever either. Please fix this! UPDATE: Was a mistake on my side, wrong hostname :) Although some kind of alert from the app could have been useful to quickly identify this. Anyway, works perfectly now!",5,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Jay Colson,"Wonderfully implemented Android client for IRC.  Very kind on your battery usage compared to other IRC clients.  Requires you to install QuasselCore on a ""server"" (could be your desktop at home), which replaces the need for an IRC ""bouncer"", as it serves the same purpose (keeping you always connected to your IRC servers as well as persisting 'scrollback' so that you can 'catch up' to what you've missed in your favorite channels.  Highly recommended!  And a great development team.",5,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Shane S.,"Like many IRC users, I enjoy chatting with folks across the world, I don't like giving up my privacy to a handful of companies, and I want to take my conversations with me wherever I go. This free, ad-free app lets me do just that, complete with notifications, synchronized chat history from desktop and web, settings galore, and surprising speed. (Full disclaimer - I've helped contribute a bit to the development, and if you have the time, I encourage you to do so, as well - it's open source!)",5,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
A Google user,"Lifesaver of an app if you use Quassel (core) and want/need to IRC on the go. I've used the old versions and this one as alpha/beta, this new version is great. The majority of the new features will only work with an upgraded core (0.13+) and it is well worth it!",5,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
s k,"Quasseldroid with a Quasselcore has been the most comfortable way to use IRC from Android for years. Very happy with it, haven't encountered major issues.",5,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid

Damian Fulmer,This is how you irc !!!,5,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid

Philip Ridout,The recent major update has improved this app in numerous ways!,5,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid

A Google user,"Bug update: URLs encapsulated in parenthesis are problematic. When opened the URL ends in a ')' breaking the link. Otherwise 5 stars.   Yet another extension of the fantastic irc client that only keeps getting better and better. Being able to connect to my core from my phone is fantastic for IRC on the go, especially since I can read the backlog and seamlessly jump from PC to phone. Thanks!",5,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid

Pedro Alvarez Piedehierro,"Really nice UI, and now is possible to see even hidden channels. I've missed that before. Thanks!",5,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Ragnhild Brosvik,"Absolutely essential for IRC users on the move. I could never go back to using a standard IRC client on my phone, getting disconnected a dozen times a day as I move in and out of signal range. I can leave it detatched in low-signal areas and reconnect later without missing out on conversations happening in my absence, saving battery. The interface is much nicer than the desktop Quassel Client. And thanks for fixing support for multiple cores - last year I had to reinstall quasseldroid when I switched to a different core, but now I can switch back and forth effortlessly. Would pay money for this app even if it didn't come with any additional features.",5,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
A Google user,"This version (0.9.8) is terribly outdated. I did not notice until it stopped working after the Android 7 update. The version on F-Droid (0.11.7) works, has an updated interface and also features automatic reconnection.",5,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
p mow,Core<->IRC disconnects can crash app.  Overall much better than Windows app!  I've also installed the beta APK from F-Droid and can confirm the auto-reconnect works great.  Side bonus: material design!,5,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Andrew Kachaniwsky,Excellent mobile companion to the quassel suite.   My only beef/request is I wish the dark theme was black and not dark grey as a background.   The grey makes it nearly impossible to read some of the colored text.,5,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Chloe Pugh,"My IRC needs are pretty basic - the fact I use a Quassel core in the first place is probably excessive... but for what it does, Quasseldroid is perfect for me.",5,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
A Google user,Make back key open the channel list on first click. Would be more useful than just popping up a message telling me to click again to quit. Could still quit on second click.,5,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid

Jos Poortvliet,"Quassel rocks, even better to have it mobile...",5,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Jared Gould,"I was recently turned on to quassel and it made irc on my phone a reasonable idea. With a typical irc client I miss a lot of what's going on while I'm not connected, and people send msgs to the wrong place all the time. Using quassel solves all of that by showing me everything I missed. And it works well!  Just 2 minor suggestions: - When switching from 4G to wifi the connection always drops. If it could reconnect automatically that would be great. Retrying all day would obviously kill battery but a few retries, maybe after a delay to let the connection establish should do the trick.  - When selecting a highlight from the notification it would be nice if the applicable channel/msg opened up automatically.",5,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
A Google user,"Amazing piece of work.  Works beautifully on my Galaxy Nexus.  Wish there were a few more customizable features, like colors and highlights.",5,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid

A Google user,"When I first started using Quasseldroid it was functional but janky. Since then it has improved greatly and is now functional, reliable, a pleasure to use and has a great ICS/JB style. The only problem I have with it is that I can't leave it connected all the time because it prevents the phone sleeping.",5,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Juan Manuel Santos,"It works perfectly. I have only found two minor issues: there's no way to open a query with another user, and if the server's certificate expires or changes you have to clear the app's data in order to reconnect. Other than that it's brilliant, thanks!!",5,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid
Sage Ross,"Quasseldroid is great if you use Quassel (which you can put on another old Android device with a Debian installation, if you want a reliable low-power always-on IRC connection). Nice interface, and almost all the features I care about. It'd be nice if it could set up the initial core account.",5,com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid

One massive issue is that I can't get it to save directly to my sd card, I have to save to phone and then transfer it over.

Ian Santopietro,"It's functional, but there are issues. Disconnect didn't work. I could only disconnect by removing the server. The Identity system requires a new identity for every connection if you connect to a ZNC with multiple networks. Nick completion only works at the beginning of the line.

Amelia Vlahogiannis,"overall a pretty good irc app, but i have noticed a few issues with the scrollback, specifically that sometimes, each time a new message is sent it scrolls back up to some previous message, until i force close the app and restart it. also, when the keyboard is opened it does not automatically scroll to line up the latest message with it. It's a bit annoying but doesn't make it unusable imo. ive also run into similar issues with other android irc clients though. (pixel 6, android 12)",4,co.aureolin.coreirc
Julian Zhou,"Hi, I wish each nick had their own color, there was a choice for the default color other than green, and away messages were grouped together like the part/join ones are. Oh and when a colored message is sent, the color goes beyond what the end of color is intended to be to the end of the message.

Only thing i dont like about it is most of the time you have to force close it in settings because the exit option under the pull down tab grays out for some unknown reason and wont let you exit the app. Also hitting dissconnect does nothing. Ive tried on more than one device, and have the very same issue.",4,co.aureolin.coreirc
Graeme McNab,"Seems good so far, the most stable irc app for android I've tried, & the notifications actually work. I would rate it higher if you could change the accent colour to anything but the horrid bright pink. That alone is almost enough reason to uninstall it for me if I could find any other irc app that didn't constantly disconnect & fail to send notifications. Update - Glad colour option is being worked on! Currently only changes top bar in light theme. Send button, toggles and dark mode still pink",4,co.aureolin.coreirc
Thorne Heathenspring,"First time I'm paying for an IRC client. Free phone clients are either buggy or lacking in features. CoreIRC seems good enough for my needs. Worth the money. Since I can't find a help #,I'd suggest a few tweaks/issues to be fixed. 1) Can't seem to autocomplete/tab nicks mid sentence. 2)Time stamps of znc doesn't sync with the client. It's important. Otherwise all the previous messages from the buffer appear with the present time stamp. 3) I faced issues initially while editing the port number.",4,co.aureolin.coreirc
Terry Cameron,"Really nice interface. Got it working. Making changes to server settings doesn't update until you force close the app and start it again, that's why I was having issues connecting. I don't see an easy way to reply to comments in the chat, this should be added. Don't like that I have to type /quote to use server commands.",4,co.aureolin.coreirc

Cody Burgess,"Use it for xdcc downloads of large files, best on the play store by far. They recently fixed a download bug after I left a review about it, so they definitely have earned this 5 stars in my eyes.

Alexander Klimashkinov,"Finally a modern irc client that after many years of searching does what I want: 1) notifications work not just for private messages but for channel messages. 2) stays connected while screen is off (most, all of the other clients seem to disconnect?). 3) works fine with my bouncer.

Alan Vallazza,Good IRC Client. Just don't like that you have to pay to have it run 24/7. But I decided to be free. So it is okay. Sometimes it won't connect. But most times it does. Basically It normally runs fine but to keep me connected to a server even if I disconnect it costs money. If you do not chat and are idle after 2.5 to 3 hours it pings out if your using it free. But sometimes it will not connect. Today when I am editing comments service is out. So forced to download a new client till they fix.,4,com.irccloud.android

And it logs all activity to a cloud sever while you are not in the app. Biggest drawback is their premium plan: it is too expensive for what you get. Stick with free version, it'll keep logging the channel activity you connected for 2 hours after you close the app, which is usually enough.

It's too large and takes up too much of the screen when the keyboard is up.                                              3 ) A dark mode and more options for text colors.,4,com.irccloud.android

Ryan Reese,"It does what I wanted - I never miss anything in my IRC channels of choice...  The app itself is functional and has all of the features that I really need, HOWEVER it is horribly white.  Unlike other clients I've used over the years, this one has no dark theme, this is a big drawback for me personally.    But the real killer is the cost.  $5 a month?  I think that the price should be lowered or the capabilities of the free version should be increased (currently you get disconnected after 2 hours of inactivity, i think it should be at least 8-12, ideally 24).  I'm OK with the 2 network limitation for free mode, but the time is the real killer and defeats the purpose of me having this app almost.    add dark theme and do something about the price.  and this will be a 5 star app.  **edit** Adding 1-star because of the new update adding the quick picture upload feature, LOVE it.  Still REALLY want a dark theme though, PLEASE!",4,com.irccloud.android
Radim Bufka,"Works much better than the apps with direct connection to irc, no dropping out. Alas, the premium for $5 is way too much in comparison with $6.5 I pay for G music all access.

Highlighting should be more prominent to stand out. Critical -> auto-scrolls to bottom of chatlog on every new message so I can't read offscreen messages on busy channels (and not so busy)! Holding the finger when sliding is not an option - as soon as you release the finger to scroll further, new messages kick in and reset the position. Last updates don't load ZNC buffer fully. Other apps load it normally. Edit: I'm not using the app, I used another one and this was as a backup. Unfortunately with the new phone the other one is not supported.

Bob Jamison,"Earlier I gave this less than 5 stars because I didn't know all of the features. Now that I am more comfortable with it, yes, full 5! It is much more stable than the ""other"" android IRC client, and maintains its connection better. One thing, tho. Is there a setting to close it when the device sleeps or screenlocks? Often I have left IRC running and have found the battery dead in the morning. The device should have been asleep. Just a PEBCAK problem I'm sure. Fine app.",5,com.countercultured.irc4android

Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time with any of the FREE IRCs or any of the other IRCs available in the Playstore.  This is not only the BEST IRC APP available, but the customized ""add on feature"" support that I requested and recieved from the Developer (Rob) blew me away.  I have never in my life recieved or even expected the level of customer service that Rob provided to me.  I can't believe this APP was only $4.99 when it is worth so much more.

Le C,"Been a premium user for a long while now, Fantastic app that works solid on both my LGG4 and my quirky Asus Z580CA.  1 thing that would make it 5 stars for me, is the ability to save to an SD card directly in the app.  So when setting an IRC server, have the ability to pick the SD card as the default location plus a folder of our choosing,   As its a right pain and time waster to download to internal storage first, more so if its a really big file, as if you not much internal storage space but lots of external storage, need the ability to use it directly..  Add that feature and you got 5* definitely.",4,com.androirc

Shane Lewis,I like the app for the DCC gets. I would have given this app 5 stars if it allowed me to automatically set my DCC receive folder to my SD card. I've read where some users claimed that they were able to save to the SD card but I don't have tthat option anywhere. So for now I have to d/l files and then move them to the sd card! P.S. I see a lot of complaints from ppl saying that this app and the paid version do not come with enough preinstalled servers!

Christopher Bonini,"Update: @blinkseb on Twitter recently said an app update is incoming!  I give this app four stars because of one issue and three missing features.  The issue I have is that occasionally, after some time in the background, AndroIRC will disconnect from the servers and then will reconnect fresh when switched back to.  For features, it would be nice (especially in regards to the above issue) if the last 20 or so lines from the last session were shown when rejoining the same channel on the same server. Logging is already built-in so this seems easy to add. Second, on servers that use NickServ authentication it would be nice if the NickServ query tab is suppressed during the initial connection. Having to close these queries gets tedious after a while. Last, I'd like an option to dismiss the user list drawer on tablets, being able to summon it with a swipe from the right just like on phones.",4,com.androirc

John Chorley,"A pretty decent IRC app. Works out of the box and ads are not intrusive.  Update:  The recent updates have made this app a lot better, and the ads are still not intrusive.  Anyway to make this review better I'd like to say it has everything a good IRC client needs and is just as good (if not better) than some of the Desktop IRC clients, granted with it being an Android App there's no plugins (none that I am aware of).  Give it a go :)",4,com.androirc
Justin F,"Still can't ignore from in-channel user list, but can op, ban, open priv msg, etc from there. Will give 5 stars when better ignore support is added (ignore by nick plus ignore by IP address).",4,com.androirc

Andy M,"The best designed and function-wise irc client on android I think. Only downside its a bit too pricey for a leisure/chat app. The technology is old, all APIs are well known etc etc so the price should hit bottom, I wouldn't hesitate to pay if it is, and I think many would agree.",5,com.androirc
wendy champion,"I use this so I can chat with everyone on osu! Whilst I don't have my PC and it's very easy to use, set up, add servers, chat. etc.) I can keep up with everything well and the highlights are great! A couple of suggestions just to improve this almost perfect app, maybe add swearing filters, and allow people to assign colours to users in order to spot them out quickly! Thanks again! ^-^",5,com.androirc
Alex Patrenko,"Great client if you like to IRC alot and just cant stand to be away from your favorite IRC server even for a moment. 5 Stars. However, its probably just my Droid, but I have trouble getting it to notify me on highlights and such. This is of no consequence though. Great app!",5,com.androirc
Ngoc Tran,"Enable logging mode and change the path of storaging logs. Then the dcc 
file transfer will work (still get errors sometimes).",5,com.androirc
Jayesh Thakkar,"The app is really good. However, in the new android versions (7.1.1 Nougat), it fails to download files completely. In old mobile with Marshmellow Android, this is not a problem. I sincerely request  the developer to resolve the issue immediately. Otherwise the app is really good and deserves 5-stars.",5,com.androirc
Mike Hess,The design of AndroIRC really impressed me. Boring protocol stuff is easily automated in settings.  Gets you straight to the chat.  Well worth the $3 bucks.,5,com.androirc
Amiga Boing,"I think the channels part should be in each server as opposed to being separate. Also User changable colored operators based on prefix would be a good addition, eg. ~Purple &Yellow @Red %Green +Blue [Grey] --- also would be nice to have color for idle users with selectable color+time, eg. After 10mins change idlers to brown",5,com.androirc
Reneh Ramsis,"It's really amazing application, have been using is for over 3 years now, but since ages ago there's a bug which really annoys me, if you're in a query with someone, and suddenly your internet connection dropped, the query will directly be unavailable, a line will appear above the name once you get disconnected, and won't be fixed till you either close the whole query or pm that person once again, it's really awesome application but if that thing could be fixed immediately would be fantastic. &lt;3",5,com.androirc

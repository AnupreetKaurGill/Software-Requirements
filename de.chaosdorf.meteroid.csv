Andy,I deposited $128.35. The funds were immediately frozen. The call center in Phnom Penh explained I need to verify my ID first. I therefore took my passport to FOUR agents located in Siem reap. All of them were too lazy to verify my ID because they receive no money in return. Shockingly bad. Do not install or use this app. You have been warned!! Money lost grrrrrr.,1,com.wingmoney.wingpay
Sanjay Kumar Behera,"Think twice before deposit your money. If the system says verify your id then it's very very difficult to do that part because the agents are either so lazy or they don't know the procedure how to verify the I'd. I faced it recently, I approached more than 10 Wing agents to verify my id but all are in vein. The agents are simply sitting and playing with their mobile but not not ready to update/verify the customer I'd.",1,com.wingmoney.wingpay

Sophea Lim,"I will not recommend any friends or family to use if this app keeps sucking money from users at all points. I can't even log in my account in another phone by myself. This app is much WORSE than some bank app. Bank app (free to use) can log in and log out in any devices we want, and we can also get interests when we deposit the money in the bank. This app doesn't provide any interests when we deposit the money, and want to suck our money whenever we want to log in another device. I don't want to give even 1 star.",1,com.wingmoney.wingpay

Angela Jolee Floria,For months on and off I have had problems with this updated PayPal App. It does not show me my PayPal Mastercard Extras Account as it should and therefore I can't see or know how much my current outstanding balance is and pay my bill online through the app. This has caused me to be told my payment is late and overdue. I was charged approx. $29.00 late fee added onto my actual bill. I am never late and have an exceptional payment history. I am very aggravated about this. Fix it!!!!,1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Abigail Scott,"This is the second time I've accidentally transferred money to my bank account for free, when I intended to pay the fee to move it instantly. I didn't notice it until I had already transferred the money and the notification said ""look for it to arrive March 14th."" I need that money now. That notification should have an ""undo"" button on it; don't finalize the transaction until I select ""okay"" on that notification.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Dillon Weir,"I use this app to pay for services. I do not want to see advertisements pushed to my phone, for Spotify or whatever other service being marketed. There doesn't seem be an option to disable that notification without disabling ALL notifications, some of which are important. Giving 1 star because I want the feedback to be seen, otherwise a great app. Will definitely uninstall if I see any more push notifications though and figure out Zelle instead",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Cassidy,"The app is basically unusable. It freezes, won't display linked accounts instead having me link them again (which it won't allow because it says they're already linked). It sends me to input screens that won't allow input and randomly asks for my fingerprint again throughout the process. I only use it when I have to send money to someone who only has PayPal. My last transfer took over 12 hours to get to work.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
G. Watterson,"It's a shame that it's so hard to try and find a real person to talk over the phone for customer service when having an issue with a transaction/payment. Tried emailing, going through the app, the website and calling multiple times just to never be able to talk to anyone. Every single time I'm automatically directed somewhere else, all of them doing nothing to help resolve my issue. Why isn't there a direct contact option in a financial website/app, it makes no sense?",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Linda K,"I liked the app OK until about a month ago. Ever since then, as soon as I log in and input the 2-factor security code, the app just disappears from the screen - poof it's gone! I have tried doing all the updates, but it keeps doing the same thing. Pretty useless app if it just disappears after you log in. Very inconvenient.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
SQUEEZEMAN,"Worst payment service I've ever used. They will hold your money for 3 weeks with no option to expedite it unless you shipped an item and your customer can confirm receipt. Don't use this to send money. On top of that now that the money actually went through, every time I try to transfer to my bank it says there's an error. Don't waste your time. The fees are high as well. Use zelle, venmo, cashapp, anything but this. There's a reason they're going out of business",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
K N,"Sooooo buggy! Doesn't even load half the time, and often freezes on my android (which is always kept updated). Also, I have a credit card already attached to my account but cannot add it to my payment options for the ""Pay in 4"" feature. So buggy and inconsistent that I feel like I just need to find another option for my online payment usage.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Jeremy Malisse,"The biggest issue here is the GARBAGE customer service people. Half or more you get someone that doesn't match the language on your profile and you spent patience repeating your problem over and over until they understand. Other times? They don't know anything, at all. My issue with the APP is that it constantly stops loading modal window content. No deposits, no transfers, NO HELP PAGE, no nothing; form responses only. Un/Re installing fixes it, but then I have to set up the app again.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Rubyhollor W,Nothing on the app is working except sending money. I've tried going to card info and other options and it requires a password. I use fingerprint and the scan keeps popping up while the page is still buffering. (My wifi and data is fine) it's either this happens or I get an error message on their side saying something is wrong. *Now it's saying it needs to be updated but the app is up to date. *Had to uninstall and reinstall it now I can view my cash card info but still nothing else.,1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
SPECIAL PROJECTS,Horrible app. You can't find anything that you need when it comes to customer service or the ability to dispute a charge without taking the better part of 30 minutes to figure it out or play with it. Somebody needs to let the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission take a look at this. Truly frustrating and anything but convenient. Have been trying to dispute a charge for 3 months and can't get to any way to do that on the app!,1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
GameCrafter117,"The app was incredible for a long time. Lately, they've made so many weird, unnecessary, and confusing changes. It's hard to tell where your money is, when it will get to where it needs to, and how much money is in your account. It's convoluted at this point. The app is flooded with junk and no longer is simple. It is now designed for you to spend money and not as a secondary bank.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
GriffyGlock,"I didn't even know there was an automatic payments tab until I was charged with a payment I thought I canceled like 2 years ago. I have no clue why it's on the bottom of the wallet page for my app, I'm just frustrated I couldn't find it anywhere on the main page in time. Hopefully I get a refund for my service or I'm not using it again, confusing.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Dave Campaniello,"So unreliable. Their framework/architecture must be obsolete as to require so many security protocols that it often becomes unusable and therefore totally unreliable as a means to move around real money quickly, easily but most importantly, reliably. Additionally, their customer service is poorly trained and basically reading off the help menu available to all users and have limited to no ability to override the automated system nor verify anything about a user or transaction effectively.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Joshua Montmeny,"The system wont allow me to add my personal checking account. Whenever I do, whether via the app or on my desktop, it fails to login just before completing the transaction. When I spoke to customer service, I was told that this was happening to protect my account, and that I should find another way to pay the recipient. In the end, Im forced to use my debit card, which incurs a fee. Horrible experience, horrible customer service, do not recommend.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Kenneth McCowan,"The new interface is terrible for for experience users. There is no obvious way to send money to anyone unless you've already sent the money previously. Additionally additionally they request comments and feedback near the bottom of the screen yet when you click on it nothing happens. I realize they think they're trying to improve the customer experience by dumbing everything down, comma but forgetting functionality completely or making it not super easy send people to competitors",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Carina Johnson,"This app is THE WORST AND HARDEST TO USE!!!! I've been with PayPal for YEARS and honestly the use of the app isn't bad. However, the app itself is almost impossible to navigate. I can never find settings to change my default payment method. I can't hardly find anything I'm looking for except for LOOOOOADS OF ADS. Needles to say, I'm looking for new app. I liked the cash card idea but it takes a week to move money over or pay a fee to to do it so I'm over that.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Lori Barra,Infuriating! The latest app update is impossible to navigate and you can no longer access many of the functions you used to be able to. There doesn't even appear to be a way to get help within the app anymore either. PayPal is seriously failing its clients at this point. If they don't fix these issues I will likely stop using their services all together. There are other platforms that are more user friendly and easier to work with when there is a problem. Do better!!!,1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Always Right,"Can no longer login using a PIN. MUST use your full password. They keep changing the app. Not little changes, but huge, major, sweeping changes. Each time they do, everyone has to start all over and learn the stupid app from scratch. The present release is a confusing, unorganized mess, and you can't even use your PIN to login.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Sam Long,I used to love this app and service and use it all the time. I was disappointed when they said they were removing the goals feature but they stated it would be replaced with something better. It's been months and still nothing. The goals feature was the best part of PayPal and made saving for big expenses so much easier. I'm currently looking for a better service to put my money into.,1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Chase Novelli,"I miss when you were able to make goal tabs for multiple things to save for, helped me alot on budgeting. I miss when contacting them was easy. I hate that you can't hit a single button for help without a sudden ""sorry"" page popping up. I hate they won't let me update or order a new card. And I hate how the layout changed into what it is. I miss using my fingerprint as a password, now it's back to typing everything in. I'll give more stars when they get better.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Joshua Nichols,"Loved the app. Had my bank account linked up and purchases were going through just fine. All of a sudden without any changes from myself paypal was trying to pull the money from a secondary account within my main account. I had alot going on and didn't notice the overdraft, just got notification from paypal saying the funds didn't go through. so I rentered my bank info right off of my checkbook to verify that it was correct,, tried it a few more time. Had about 9 overdraft fees ~$270",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Andre Perry,"Horrible UI. Could not log in because I had an old phone number and had to enter a new one, but it did not accept it until I went to the website itself. When being requested money, it did not show a notification for it and when trying to pay an invoice, I had to exit out multiple times before i could click ""pay now"". Horrible service. I expected much better from a multi-billion dollar corporation.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Megan Huffman,"Tried all afternoon to send money to a friend in need (someone I've known for over a decade, definitely not a scam).

Jared Coogan,"Paypal has fallen a long way since the good old days. I will have to stop using it with all the new ""regulations"" they have in place.

Frozengeckolover,"I'm mad that I had to download the Paypal app just so I could turn off the ""top up"" feature for Google Pay. That feature should not have been turned on without my consent, and I should have been able to access that feature on the website. I used Google pay in a store, my total was 57 cents over my balance, and Paypal transfered $10 to cover it. I would rather the purchase was declined. You guys are going to end up overdrafting someone's bank account with that nonesense.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
PunkNPi3,"This app is absolutely garbage, jumping through hoops to sign into my account after a couple years not using it because I didn't need it back then but now I need an app like this but I literally cannot get into my account on the app even after setting up everything correctly on the website.

Deleting immediately",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
zachary jordan,"Just terrible. Everything i needed from this app, it has failed at miserably. I sent an item to a buyer. The item was delivered going on 3 days now and my funds are still on hold. I attached a tracking number as well. So while my buyer is enjoying my product, I get my money dangling in my face. I feel cheated. Not to mention you can't get in contact with anyone from paypal for assistance. Its just a bad experience I would NEVER recommend. If I could rate 0 stars, I would.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Petrice Eisele,"Every time I try to use the app (for over a year) and I even downloaded it on my new phone hoping it would be different, but the app allows me to put in user name a password, than flashes on the screen then disappears to the ""bottom"" of the screen, and I try to open it it again and again it shrinks itself.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Kolia Adamson,"SO difficult to set up and use, and it took me nearly a week to get it to accept any money. It glitches out constantly so it never shows you your balance and it only let's you convert currency about half the time. You have to have at least $10 in there to transfer your balance to your bank account, and even still more often than not it will not allow you to send it at all. Way easier apps to use, I wish I could give it less than one star.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Eric Sua,"Terrible scam app, I was charged twice for the same transaction which put my account in negative and then charged overdraft fees and return items fee, and then charged a third time for the same transaction. I ended up paying around $500 for a $50 transaction.

eddie duffy,"The 12/1/2021 ""update"" is a downgrade in every regard and is completely unusable. In an attempt to achieve a corporate minimalistic aesthetic, they have removed or hidden functions while accentuating crypto and shopping. I primarily used PayPal to transfer funds between freinds but this feature seems to be missing. The old layout was perfect, why break it.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Monique M.,"If you are downloading for the $5 deal, it is a false advertisement. I've sent a message already to PayPal requesting they update the wordage or remove the ad stating you will receive $5 if you download the app. The app is also slow to load payments and the web page has a clearer user interface. After PayPal gets back to me concerning the false claim of receiving $5 I'm removing the app. Takes up too much space and the web page is easier to use.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Mark Wallace,"This is by far the most frustrating and effed up app I have ever used. You would think that the longest standing electronic payment method would be more reliable and user friendly, but in my experience, it is not. It fails multiple times I try to make a payment and it is extremely frustrating. Use any other besides this one!",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Michell Hardwick,"So, I decided to redownload my pay pal app. I was able to change the password and do all of the security with no issues. As I was logging in, it stated I needed to call!

It's gone down hill over the years.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Alton Chappell,Pure trash and customer support is even worse. For well over aonth i have not been able to get into my paypal credit card through this app. Keep getting ( oops something went wrong on our end ) how long does it take to fix this error.

Anastasiya Z,"I'm not necessarily rating the app, but the app also sucks, I feel like the messaging center and contact buttons could have been located better. The main screen projects you credit information first instead of like a menu that u can choose different options. I'm not loving it.

Please",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Whitney Bridwell,"The app is full of bugs. Almost never opens the credit page and gives the ""bad request"" page. It's basically worthless to have the app if this feature isn't working.

Florian Poullin,"So many bugs... I created my account in 2004. Now it's a nightmare. I sometime see old information from years ago but I can't edit them in the settings anymore.

Mike C,"If you ever need to refund a payment it is a nightmare and you have to pay fees. So disappointed with PP and can't wait for Wise or a different service to become more widely used. Awful exchange rates that can cost you a huge amount vs the true rate. They mark transfers as free to hide this. So if you're transferring 475 USD to a GBP account, you will lose around ¬£30 with the exchange rate. If you can then definitely avoid PayPal. I personally have been using them for years and feel tricked.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
MudBud,Couldn't set up an account. When I put in my phone number I got no message and I tried lots of times and then it told me to skip this step but there was no option to actually skip the code message step so I just couldn't set up an account.

Roger House,"Unable to use app as it just says ""we are having difficulty completing your request at the moment"". Won't work with fingerprint, password or code.

Now unusable.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Jake H,"For one, this app is basically useless. Two, PLEASE consider making password resets even remotely possible. You can't do it in the app, and the website tells me I need to respond to a prompt in the app to verify that it's me, no other options. I can't use my phone, email, or my authenticator codes. I MUST respond to this prompt in the app. The best part is that the prompt doesn't exist, so I can't respond to it.

Nicholas Tucci,"worst app ever! not intuitive at all! much better Revolut app for handling moneys. In my case I did a payment at the time with PayPal but for some reason it didn't get money from the associated card.

Sarah Wynd,"I'm trying to report a problem with a recent purchase, however, the app keep flicking out and I have to start again. Funny how it's still.doing this after a few years. Almost like PayPal doesn't want you to get your money back on a faulty product.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Mercedes Johnson,Used to love using PayPal but not anymore. Recently had to change my phone number and not only did it take two weeks through email and customer support to change it for the two-factor Authentication. But once it was changed it's still kept popping up with my old number for my login security check. Making my PayPal completely unusable.,1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
lordbossharrow,Uhhh I can't login through the app. Keeps asking for login details. Inputted it and it just keeps asking for it without even saying wrong password etc. It just keeps reloading the login page. I can login fine with the exact same credential on the website.,1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Turama Tuhura,"The app is pretty simple to use but you get no help at all from the customer support team. It's been a few weeks & they still haven't replied to my plea to verify my email so I can start using paypal. No one answers when you call them, emails & chats don't work so they expect you to find help through their faq's page. Waste of time & a huge lack of customer service.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Pierre Durand,"This app USED to work just fine. NOW I can no longer log in, even after using BOTH my fingerprint AND a 2FA code. The app prompts me to call. I called, they got me in, now I'm right back to the app asking me to call to verify, after making me enter a code TWICE mind you. Ridiculous. At least I can still access my account through the browser when I'm actually sitting down at a computer. I have cleared cache, uninstalled and reinstalled the app and nothing works. This really has me weighing security vs. convenience. I will no longer be using PayPal for payments until this is fixed.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
D A V I D,Very simple question I asked if I could send money through my checking account or savings account in order to save on the fee which was $6.10 using my debit card as I sent $200. Which costed me $206.10. Nowhere could I find on the PayPal m the PP App a clear answer that sending through checking or savings was instant or at least within 30 minutes. I texted customer service they responded that they are checking on it. Can't believe this question I was the first person to ever ask this question,1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Rubens Furbetta,"Crashes every time after the last update. I tried to clear cache, clear data and reinstall the latest version, but nothing helped. Previous versions are not allowed to be installed. What now, Paypal ? Please drop this and go back to version 7.x which used to work perfectly.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Shawn Burns,"App doesn't retain your linked bank info. So when you have to send money, PayPal charges a fee instead of, if it retained your bank info, you would not get charged a fee. Or it is PayPal being greedy and ripping people off to make more money for themselves.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Carl Nielsen,Been using it for awhile and had no issues. Now I'm stuck in an infinite loop. Wants me to verify who I am with a text code. Sends me the code but kicks me back to the log in screen before I can enter it. After logging in again says I need to verify with a text code and so on.,1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Nathan Spears,I tried to close my account like 2 years ago. Every single time I make a transaction there is some kind of b#llsh!t. Now I'm having to wait not the 10 days that they say but from the 12th to the 2nd to get my money. Ib sent the wrong person a payment and texted them to let them know and they agreed to send it right back to me. But for some reason that's not proof enough for PayPal? Get a clue paypal!,1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Austin Tyler,"They recently partnered with Ingo, which is a new company? Idk they make you wait 10 business days just to cash a check and they charge a $5 fee to get it the same day. It's ridiculous because the way was never that long. It was usually 1-2 business days. On top of that they didn't accept a check I submitted for mobile deposit and even tho PayPal allows you to resubmit checks, Ingo does not. So it's impossible for me to cash this check. It's just paper with $300 and my name on it now.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Zain Amjad,"App has started crashing on startup. Have cleared the cache, data, and reinstalled but happens everytime. If I quickly click on a different tab like crypto it's fine, as soon as I switch to the homescreen it crashes!",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
R S,"Paypal holds your money for there profits, they don't care who , how , amount or your situation, they always hold your money from you being able to use it. I wish I could give them -10 stars. I don't know how they get away with it or who we are all so stupid and still use PayPal at all. There are so many better apps to send and receive money.",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Jennifer Lynne,Bleck!! You've made me verify my identity 3 times. You made me a verified seller for my cleaning service. I thought that would take care of the issues but no. EVERY time I receive payment from a client you hold the payment. So I have to wait 3 weeks for payment of a service that has been completed. I had a client that just blatantly lied after payment and disputed her bill and you granted in her favor so I only received $188.00 for a $500 job. With paying employees I lost money.,1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Skye Finley,"It's cool, the only thing I don't like is how I have to go to my browser to transfer money and to the resolution and help center. While transferring money to my bank it forces me to use xoom which I don't want to use. The help and resolution center doesn't even load. And you can only take $400 a day out the atm. Update I just uninstalled it, causing too many problems and I only use the browser now which you can't unlock your card if it gets locked. Update: Now stuff on the browser won't work smh",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Mitchell Peterkin,"okay, my daughter is teaching me again. It's fine now that I know what I'm doing, at my age I don't like change but I deal with it. Happy with the app now, so back to five stars. I've had the pleasure of using PayPal for quite awhile, that pleasure has turned into a nightmare. told by phone all is well, but not true and I'm not going to keep logging in one app then another and so on, whoever remade this app should be fired. the old addage if it ain't broke DON'T FIX IT!!!!",1,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Andre R,"When they changed the format it makes it impossible to find what you're looking for. Trying to change the address on my cards and I can't find how. The help menu has the question but when you click on it nothing happens. Tried to do online chat and same thing, nothing. The app uses too many symbols and is not clear. Please fix this because it's frustrating.",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Duggie,"3/23/22 recent update *Card controls broken* Fraud is up, and all these convenient money apps are getting hit hard, so keep that in mind when using these types of services. I've had 2 problems with unauthorized charges on my account in the last year and a half. Fortunately, both times I was able to get customer service to lock and reset my account. My account was credited with lost/stolen funds. PayPal made it right. Convenient, but I can't recommend using them for very much $",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Bailey Lambright,For being a front runner in online banking I expected a lot more. It's cluttered and hard to find what your looking for. The fees are very high to move money to your own linked accounts. And paying for faster transfers is a joke. Still took several days to deposit back into the account that funds my paypal. Shopping discounts are nice but can be found elsewhere. Still can't get debit cards.,2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Amdarela,Love how easy the APP is to use and the security it provides./ ******Update 3-25-22: I have been having ongoing problems with trying to pull up more transaction. It rarely opens the page and just shows a spinning circle like the page just won't load. I have been having this problem for several months. My APP is up to date. Please fix this problem.,2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Joe Mendoza,"The app is having trouble loading the credit card payments options, Ever since I got approved for the card. Now I cannot access any part of the credit area. ""Ops there was an error on our end, please try again later"" has been going on for far to long. This ""error on your part, is costing me my credit. It's like a set up to destroy your credit, The BBB will definitely be hearing of this.Thanks..",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Renee Debolt,"Not a very easy interface. The menu is tap, tap, tap, tap..... To get where you want. To create invoices it's repetitive screens for a description, all small case, very little space to see what you've typed. Adding tracking info stinks too because instead of the Back button to take you to the next customer, again, it's tap, tap, tap..... The main menu. Not a real fan of the mobile app.",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Eric Johnson,"The app focuses more on trying to sell you stuff then on actually helping you to take care of transactions. You can't even edit the billing address on a debit card, the editing ability is useless if you can't edit the card! The only online help in the app acted as if I was using the desktop version. I don't always have access to a desktop or laptop computer, that's why I need the app!!! Fix this issue and include appropriate help pages, and make it easier to figure out how to do simple tasks!",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
William Lewis,"The only real upside to the app is that it makes doing basic tasks a bit quicker. Besides that, there's really no point in it. It lacks some of the online account options, as well as withholds a lot of important PayPal information that customers should know. If you examine the apk of the app, it also leaves me with a few privacy questions, too. Paypal has become a little too big for their own good, they're getting lax and arrogant. Shame, too, I've used them for over a decade now.",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Toni D.,Can't update card addresses or info via the app and unable to add my bank account. After putting in bank login info it just loops me back to a page to add a bank or card. But neither of the buttons work. Very strange and glitchy. Navigation on the app is not very intuitive. I often have to hunt for what I need. Least preferred payment option.,2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Jeffery Keeney,"Since before the pandemic the app will not let a user pay their PayPal Credit bill via the PayPal app. Bad request error message comes up. Have to log in via desktop. I suspect this is intentional so users have to pay late fees. I paid Synchronoy aka PayPal Credit and the payment was sent back to PayPal, yet the money went missing and never EVER went back into my account. I ended up getting hit with a late fee and PayPal kept $40. Been a user since they were owned by eBay.",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Finmide,"This would be a 1 star rating but they keep deleting my review so they can keep their appearance up. Paypal used to be good when they stood up for you. Now they don't, if an unauthorized payment is made they flag it as suspicious, but then let it through anyways and won't refund the money that was used for the unauthorized purchase. Not only that but they claim every purchase is a preapproved recurring payment (a subscription) and use that as why they don't refund you. Even for 1 time purchases.",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Troy Blaser,"Not intuitive at all which is strange because their subsidiary Venmo is. One example, if you have already paid another user you cannot navigate to that user from the payment history view. There is an icon that represents the user but it is not clickable. If they aren't one of your ""friends"" on PayPal it can be really hard to find them because the search functionality doesn't prioritize the user you have already paid. I wish there were more room to type here because I have more examples.",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Ryan Evans,"Here's the reason for my 2 star review: Overall, the PayPal app is well designed. However, there are a few points that I feel could use improvement. When logging in, if I choose to have a security code sent so that I can change my password, I have to retrieve the code from my messaging app and if I minimize the PayPal app it takes me right back to square one which is really annoying. Logging in with the pin is easy but if you haven't already enabled that option....",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Melissa Gibson,"I do not like the new interface. Difficult to navigate. It takes forever to load. When I redo what needs redone it wont verify my number because my type of number is not supported... It's Verizon. Not some throw away number. If I had an option, and I don't, but we all should have to option to keep the old PP instead of being stuck with this one. Once a strong user of paypal I'm going to be looking at my options. Personally, I don't care for it.",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Nicole Mateja,Service used to be AMAZING. Been a PayPal user for 15yrs and after the last couple I use it less and less. Currently it works as long as you're not trying to get your STOLEN money back. Apparently now when you add PayPal to anything you're automatically giving them clearance to charge you whatever and whenever they want. And you can't file a dispute because the page locks up every time you click submit. I have tried a dozen times to dispute 2 charges and it freezes at the same spot every time.,2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Mike Shay,I used it three times. With perfect success. Now it's refuses the link my credit or debit card to my banK. IT'S TOTALLY USELESS NOW. UPDATE: PayPal now works again. BUT I recently used it and theere was a problem. There was a server problem on the receiving end. The store never received the payment. They told me that my money was returned to my account BUT IT WAS NOT. As a result I lost $60. Not happy.,2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Ms. Harley,Soooo irritated! Been using the PayPal credit card for a good while. But the last few months I can't even login to that section to pay my balance. Continuously says sorry about that there's an error on our end. FIX IT ALREADY tired of calling in to have them help me pay. Constantly updating to try and retify the problem and that doesn't do it either,2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Bee3,"I've been using the original app without issue for years. This new update, however, prevents the ability of my saved password from being entered! Makes the app useless, might as well use the website! I have my own security settings in place, I don't need PayPal to take away my option to fill in my saved password! Frustrating.....",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Tony,Crummy app that offers no convenience at all. It's slow and clunky and most of what you have to do to edit your account has to be done through the website. To edit your banks or make any changes is impossibly slow. The only thing the app is good at is sending money to friends. The app offers extremely limited tools and is just a plain headache to use. I hate the app and I don't use it for more than just checking my balance.,2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Dillinger Bennett,"Ok, I used to like the app, it was very basic, why 2 stars, because I don't care about the updates, every update it'll pop up on your phone like an annoying ad that you can't get rid of, I'll update, just to get it to stop. I really don't care about any new version, I just keep it for emergencies, like at this point it gets annoying, please delete this feature",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
royce royce,"Tldr: save your device storage, y'all! App is subpar, web browser is still most accurate 3 years in/out of trying to humor the app. This year: No, you don't get $5 for downloading the app and ""linking it"" before the end of 2021. Or, based other reviews besides mine, don't count on it. I cannot fathom why they advertised an app that was this glitchy with logins, among other complaints, without clear bug fixes. As is, it's a mess sprinkled with some misleading representation of deals for syncs.",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Anna D,"Latest update makes the interface look more like a dating app than a financial tool. You can't tell if a line item is an unpaid invoice or not. You have to navigate to see your balance. Half of the screen (not an exaggeration) taken up with a button wanting me to add a picture. And I used to be able to tell when something had shipped because it would say ""track shipment"" under it. No longer...sigh. Dammit, PayPal. What was wrong with the functionality of the last update?",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Andrew Versaw,"Has all the features you'll need and nice integration with Google Pay. The big problem is is that it randomly fully signs me out so I can't log in with my fingerprint or pin. It also doesn't work at all with Password managers, and it clears out the username and password everytime you switch the app over. Equally frustrating is that every web browser based feature in the app doesn't work most of the time and just gives you a blank page. It's a fleshed out app but it needs lots of bug fixing...",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Rebekah Wilens,"It's so unintuitive, especially when something goes wrong. I had a payment pending for 3 weeks, there's no click through to cancel the payment or find out more. Then to ask about it through the help page, if you need to check the transaction ID (or even switch to another app to see the screenshot of the transaction info) the whole form resets itself. This is like, app usability 101,especially for a payment app.",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
iisi √∏,"Confusing. When returning to the main screen, sometimes there's a ""More"" button, sometimes just ""Send"" & ""Request"" buttons. When tapping the ""More"" button, sometimes there are 4 items, sometimes a whole screenful. When viewing ""details"", there's NO new info that wasn't on the main screen, except for a comment that there's no fee for sending to friends/family. Transaction history is sparse on details. Searching contacts doesn't show all matches for a name, forcing me to search by address.",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Dwight Hall,"Great service. The problem is, when I go to transfer from Bank to paypal, the app will sometimes crash without confirming. I dont even get an email either. After a few tries, I find out that all the transaction went through, and all of a sudden I get email notifications confirming the transactions. This is highly suspect, and have been charged for nsf fees.",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Jeremy Toepfer,"It's great there is no fee when using checking account. I don't like that the send again list only shows 2 people I sent money to years ago and not the people I have sent money monthly for the last several months. I like that it pulls from contacts but it only shows partial contact names so if I have several people with the same first name it gets difficult, I have to compare the number against the name and number in my contacts. I was a lengthy process to link my checking account.",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Leona Miller,"Useful and easy for making payments. Unfortunately, as far as any other functions (messages, notifications, disputes, etc.) it doesn't seem to work or properly connect at all.

Jessica Alger,"Be very careful when making your selections, I somehow said that I wanted to make PayPal credit an option and it got selected once, the late fee for a balance I didn't realize I had was higher than the original purchase! This was total oversight on my part but it could have been costly. Customer service did help but he was extremely rude and condescending. Also at some point good and services became a default setting, so it needs to be changed everytime. IMHO a better app could be invented.",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
A Google user,"Works most of the time, but updating/removing addresses, and changing/adding new info types (cards, phone numbers etc) , which are all core uses other than paying for things, mostly don't work properly. The desktop site is better, but marginally. When choosing shipping addresses, it tends to be a gamble on if it'll use my Preferred one, or just whichever it wants, so triple check.",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
victor johnson,Terrible. The security check always keeps me from using PayPal for purchases on my phone. It only does the ID verification via text with no other options. The problem is the texts often do not come through. Now they can do like all other apps on the planet earth and offer a different method of verification by calling the number instead of texting but I guess the PayPal engineers haven't caught up with the rest of the world yet and figured that out. Ended up using a competing pay method.,2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Alyssa Smith,"I've already reached out to PayPal through the Contact Us links, and I am waiting for a reply that isn't automated. I wanted to link a few contacts but instead it linked my ENTIRE contact list without option.

rebecca kasten,"your update has made it completely impossible to get help on any transaction, especially if it is for a refund, where you have to memorize your transaction ID instead of being able to go through the transaction to request the refund.

Lana R Stalling,"Lots of features. Once setup, sending & receiving money is fast. I like that you can use a bank account or a credit card. Took off 1 star: There are other options such as cashapp, venmo, square. Not sure why PayPal charges businesses transaction fees, while others don't. I don't like credit card fees to send to family. Taking 2 stars off for how long it took for setup - The setup on Paypal was extremely time consuming. Had to send personal documents that took months for them to respond to.",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Frank Magowan,"For some reason I couldn't download the PDF statements so that I could check my current APR. It almost seems intentional. I finally resolved the issue by going to my account with Google Chrome and going to the identical page that I did in the app and the links for downloading the PDF statements work just fine. This bug needs to be fixed immediately. I would give only 1 star right now if it weren't for the fact that viewing available credit balance, transactions, and making payments all work good",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Ace Hart,"Just got ripped off. I attempted to use their CVS deal where you get $10 back from a $20 purchase. When the cashier scanned the QR code, only $12.66 of my purchase was paid.

Pj Koehnle,"I just wanted to inform PayPal that I am, again, unhappy with the services I've received recently. I have updated my payment preference and had it saved, since September to be exact, but just noticed that instead of paying with the linked bank account as it was my preferred payment, my recent transactions have been charged to my credit card saved on file instead.

Jonathan Oates,"The app offers free transfers to family and friends, however paying for goods and services is always defaulted so if you forget to change the setting, PayPal is going to get a chunk of that money you just sent for bills/etc. The app really needs a confirmation screen where you choose whether you are paying for goods and services or sending to family and friends.",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile

Roy Anderson,"The app is incredibly slow. When I applied for the credit card, I was initially approved, and then they decided that I was a possible ""fraud"" and reversed their decision, leaving me with a hard enquirybon two credit bureaus reports. Moving from screen to screen takes at least 5 seconds. One would expect better from PayPal! The app starts storing lots of data and becomes clogged up.

Crystal Hopper,"I enjoy the flexibility and the budgeting tools- however, I used the account to pay important bills and then the payment was stopped even though the money was in the account. I called to find out why and it was my fault for thinking you could use your account numbers for more than direct deposit.

Alicia Donnell,The app appearance and all the stuff that it says it does is wonderful. Hopefully they can updated or something so that it actually performs that way though.

cody Lovelace,It's ok..... Makes it convenient but I don't like the fact that someone can pull money out of your PayPal if they change their mind on their purchase from you.I've had this happen first hand.

Radio Bug,"Its mostly convenient, but when it isn't it becomes a much bigger problem than alternatives. Let's be honest: there almost always seems to be a glitch or an issue getting in the way of important financial tasks. The devs (programmers...?) Are slow to fix, and the name PayPal is so divisive that half of my clients vow to never install it while the other half are just okay with it. It used to be better. Slowly yet surely they are turning into an evil bank.",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Spirit Messages Tarot,Used to be able to see on a computer what your balance was before and after a transaction but it seems that option has disappeared.

Gordon Lippa,"I wondered why I didn't have this app installed, then after installing remembered. It's not any good. Transferring funds out of pp into your bank is not intuitive.

Jessi Cone,"well, PayPal Credit information is very limited in the mobile app. i can't get to my Statement and i don't want to receive paper statements by mail. on top of that, I actually appreciated that PayPal Credit did NOT report to any credit bureaus (or at least not the 3 major ones). that meant it had no impact on DTI ratios or Credit Utilization %. Now their creditor is Synchrony and I do see them on my Credit Report. on the + side, i guess I have a higher credit limit.",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Anthony,"Honestly I like PayPal. But certain things don't show up in my account or out of my account in a timely fashion. On top of that, the most recent update doesn't require a password or fingerprint until you try to make a transfer or something. Which means anyone can see my activity on there. Granted they can't necessarily move money around but I like the old way better. Before you could see anything at all, it would require a password/fingerprint. That's how it needs to go back to.",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Blue Beast,frustrating.. it's good for paying websites that you do not trust however it's set up recurring payments that I did not want and when I followed the help menu to where I should be able to manage that in the app it just didn't exist.

William Geller,"The app functions fine for transactions. However, editing info, adding cards, etc. the app encounters many errors and indicates errors when it properly completes an action (e.g., adding a card successfully saying but indicating an error).

Cleaning up how the app manages its threads and processes would most likely greatly improve the app.",2,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Esther Hubbard,I have 2 bank accounts and somehow PayPal has lost the confirmation for my second account. I keep trying to reconfirm the account but they never send the two small deposits so I c confirm the account. It's very frustrating. I don't understand what the problem is!

Louis Privette,"I find this app to be sub-standard and buggy, especially considering its coming from a well established company. I activated Finger Print access, but still requires entering password every time!?! And then asks again if I want to activate fingerprint access again.

Ed Ditlefsen,"Latest version of the app is trying hard to catch up with ""modern"" features that other apps have had for years. The ""Recent Activity"" card disappears after tapping it once, requiring a force close of the app to get it back. The chatbot assistant was worthless.

Well when your in the middle of a tranfer & the app crashs when you try again the app thinks your a hacker & starts throwing security checks up like gang signs.

Patricia Smith,"I used to thoroughly enjoy the efficiency of this app. That is, until they decided to start sending the money to my transaction recipients with a 3-5 days hold, even though they've collected from my bank.

All Things Gatewood,"PayPal charges for anything you send or receive now. They can't be doing well since they've started doing that.

Krystal S,"I used PayPal for 2 yrs to send money to family that doesn't have Zelle with their bank, but it doesn't make sense for me anymore. They provide great service through a fine app. But I don't agree with their policy anymore, so I closed my account. I wired a grand overseas through my bank for $5.

Gidti L,"Annoying, intrusive, and possibly insecure behavior of the app opening on its own and demanding I update it. The rest of my experience of the app was good and fine until that. If I did not tap anything to activate PayPal; there is no reason it should take over my screen.   That behavior alone is incredibly intrusive, like being on most web pages these days with annoying popups, except its an installed app on your phone. Not only annoying, if someone else had my phone for someone reason its advertising a way to steal from me.

The message center could use some work, typing messages on mobile can be slow, and using the common issues points don't always solve the problem.  One other thing I'll say is that recently, about four days prior to writing this review, I've been having problems with some of the menus not loading, specifically under the ""create savings goals"" though it isn't limited to that. Some menus like the settings and send to bank work fine, but goals have been having issues, which sucks because that is a feature I like.

The few times I've had an issue, I've had to get on a computer to pursue resolving it. Very frustrating.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Beariq,"It's functional, but not a proper mobile alternative to the website. You can't cancel pending payments, or accept pending payments either, so if both you and the recipient are both using the app, the money just sits in the void until someone figures out you have to use the actual website. I ended up having to Google what to do after 3 weeks of the payment being stuck in pending. In my opinion, either have the app be entirely functional, blatantly in beta stages, or don't have one at all because it's all far too confusing",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Hannah Jane,"Would love to rate higher, but a recent change on the app may result in need to switch apps. I love banking with PayPal, but due to the removal of the savings goal feature in the recent update, I do not have a separate account for my savings anymore which makes it difficult to accurately budget. Hopefully an alternative option will be offered in the future.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Charlene Rollins,"It has changed a great deal over the years, not sure if all the changes were better. It is eady enough to navigate, can usually find what you need but forget ever finding a way to actually talk to a human being about any issues on the phone. They want it all to go over the app, through email, etc. Talking to a live customer rep is extremely difficult and almost none existant through the app.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Colin Stuart,"The most frustrating thing about the app is it won't work with my password manager (Lastpass) which makes it a huge PITA to even log into. The navigation is non-intuitive, and if you get to the app via a notification (eg ""you've received money""), you can't navigate to the PayPal home screen to take other actions, and the back button kicks you out of the app.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Rachel M,"Sending money within the US works well, but they give bad conversion rates if it's another currency. There's an option to let my credit card company do the conversion, but for most currencies it doesn't work. You just click the button and it keeps converting on PayPal with no explanation. In the end it's not that much money, bur constantly getting nickel and dimed is tiring and frustrating. Makes me not want to use the product.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
John Oberly,"New extra authorization steps usually do not work. Replying to a text message to initiate a payment causes the app to indicate it was successful, but then says something went wrong, and the payment fails. I've jumped through those hoops several times and eventually it just stops asking for the additional text authorization and it works, but that's usually after at least 3 attempts.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Rachel Yonts,"I LOVED this app until recently when it became somewhat unreliable. Once I manage to get on the app, it's fine. BUT lately, when I get on to check my balance or do anything else, it freezes while loading and I have to back out of the app and try again in a few minutes. A couple of times, I've had to uninstall then reinstall it. Pleae fix this.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
A Google user,"i appreciate the service, but it has some subtle issues that make using the system difficult and confusing. i was sent money, and because i did not approve for receiving funds the money was returned to the sender. i went on believing the money was transferred into my account but it wasn't. also, at times finding individuals to transfer funds on the search system can be a chore, and feels a little like a leap of faith, not being completely sure if the money is going to the correct person.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Suzanne Cakalic,"Never had a problem until I went to pay an invoice for over $1000. Then all kinds of crazy happened! Had to log back in, reset password, reenter bank info and then it didn't even show the bank as an option to pay. Never in entire time I've been using it have I had even one of these issues.

Rox K.,"Wow. What a case of redesign fail! I have loved & used PayPal for many many years (was an early adopter, even prior to smartphones). I understand the want/desire for the cash card, but taking up so much real estate on the home screen is a mistake. Plus, what kind of product manager decides to allow redesign of an app (that has always had a signature logo/color) back to WHITE (?!!) - just when we're getting the research results in about how bad the white of our screens is?! Argh! Might have to go to a mirror site & reinstall the prior version. SO disappointed, cuz I am a big fan (and very frequent user) of PayPal. The functionality itself is great (as expected) but I surely hope they change these issues.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Tanuki H,"App and service isn't bad, but figuring out how to manage your password and change it is a hassle that it should not be mostly because it can't be done from the app. On top of that the capcha that they try and make you use on the web page doesn't work or reload when they force you to log back in (Which I ended up doing with out the new password that they forced me to make?) Very frustrating experience.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Kurt Benson,"Paypal is straightforward when you use it with Ebay. Otherwise, the app makes things much more painful than they need to be in this day and age. Navigating between sending and receiving money without being somehow derailed is always a challenge. The automated help section and customer support are virtual...ly worthless. And could they make the fees for service more elusive? I hate the app for Android, except when I'm on Ebay. Thus, I give it an average 3-star rating.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
V Dobbs,"I like the convenience of being able to do transfers, however, one thing I hate is how it no longer defaults to ""sending to friends and family"" when I am sending to the same family member over and over. It needs to operate the same way the computer version does where it defaults to the last chosen option for that person.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Mark Lystrup,"The ability to pay the credit card has stopped working in the app for the last few months. You go to click on the bank to pay it from, then the app wants you to re-add the routing numbers. My wife and I have both done this, then it just restarts, never allowing you to actually pay. This was the case on our Google pixels, our new Pixel 3a's, and my Samsung tablet. Please fix this issue, as it is very inconvenient to get to a desktop and pay on there.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Vicki James,Somehow I've lost the ability to sign in with just my fingerprint in one sweep. I now have to click to open the window to choose the option for fingerprint then use my fingerprint! Even though I have all the settings appropriately marked. Additionally what happened to the option to cancel a transaction of your own immediately after making it?,3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Donald Hyatt,"For the most part works fine. Possibly a little buggy since the UI updates. Specifically with the transferring funds UI. Defaults to transferring the entire PayPal balance, but when that number is changed it sometimes takes multiple interactions for the the ""transfer X"" value at the bottom to change. Uncertainty or mistakes in this type to situation is at least very annoying and at worst can cause big issues.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Alex Carr,if you have ever used a browser or another device to access payPal then you can expect issues. the app gets cranky and doesn't respond and not intuitive in the explanation of the different options. I also had issues with it because of an account I had from several years ago and because of a dot lacking in my email address this app gave me hell trying to get it corrected. I have a pending and as I expected it went sideways. Took 3 calls to get support. Support helped and finally resolved.,3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Jennifer Norell,"The app is flacky when it comes to notifications. It works for a bit, then stops. I've contacted customer support on several occasions and their answer is generally to either reboot the app or reinstall the app. I really don't want to have to reinstall or reboot every time the app isn't working. PayPal does the same thing in Messenger. It'll work for a short bit and then stop and of course it's your phone that's causing the problem not them, they don't fix anything on their end. üòï",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Jeremiah,"This app is great in a few ways, but it is absolutely infuriating that I can't edit/change/delete the primary shipping address. I can easily edit alternative addresses no problem, but it doesn't give me the option to even click on the primary address to update or change it. Thanks to this, I have had stuff ship to my old address, which is frustrating. I am able to edit the primary address in a web browser, why the hell is this not an option in the app?",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Alan Fox,"Why does this app only work in portrait mode on tablets? This is highly undesirable. Look up pictures of people using tablets, 90% are in landscape mode (You know, like a laptop or desktop). Maybe fine for phones, but definitely should be an option for tablet users, it's an easy thing to add this in an update and would be a much welcomed feature.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Molly McGaffick,"This app is okay, but there are features that are NOT self-explanatory, such as the refund button. After seeing a charge that was not authorized on my account, I hit the ""refund"" button, and it sent the money to that person AGAIN! So they got money out of me twice, which was upsetting to me. This was not the only issue with PayPal either, but it is just a prime example of the confusion I've dealt with.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Sarah Jones,"When it works properly it's a 5 star app, but lately have had problems receiving money and getting any technical support. Was recently on the phone for over an hour trying to unblock my account due to my bankcard being lost or stolen. And also keeps making me log in several times during ONE transaction. That's very annoying. But on the whole, a good app for sending money and online purchases.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Shannon Ramey,"Usually LOVE PayPal & recommend it to everyone I know. I've encouraged many friends to use PayPal as a way to easily send $ to 1 another. However lately, whenever they send $, my friends are charged a hefty fee to do so. I tell em to be sure that they choose the friends & fam option before sending. They say that's what they did. I've noticed too, when I send $, I'm unable to do this. I'm told of friends & merchants, but unable to choose either before I'm prompted to send $ now & pay a big fee",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Ashley Simpson,"I absolutely love this app, the goal features, and the debit card. BUT something needs to move faster with bank to paypal transfer... when your bank releases your money but its still unavailable in paypal after 5 days this is too long! even three days is too long. You really have to plan because your money is floating in limbo and unavailable in the meantime. Very frustrating.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Reid Kenney,"Overall it works. But there's one huge UI oversight: when asked to provide additional info for large transactions, the birthdate entry field doesn't have drop-downs for day/month/year. Instead, it makes you scroll back through EVERY month you've lived to select the date. So every time this happens, I scroll or tap like a madman 290 times.

So if you were born in 1990, thats 22√ó12 or 244 button presses to enter your birthday. I tried swiping and pressing elsewhere to go back a year at a time, but no. You also can't just type it. It's like UI designers are competing to see who can make entering basic information more inconvenient.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Jake Martin,"The App was working great but now it is a pain to log into. I'm not sure what happened to cause this. My PIN never works even after I change it. My passwords don't save, the window for saved email/pw stays on the screen blocking view. I've updated. I've tried re-installing. Nothing fixed it. Once I'm finally logged on it works as usual.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Chronic Gutz,"It would be a pretty good app if the fingerprint feature would actually work. Also, the 2-step verification process is really frustrating. I will get the text for my code, but because PayPal sends 2 texts I can't just pull down my preview bar. Instead, I need to open my text app, which in turn, will take my PayPal app out of the 2-step screen and back to my password. Overall it's a decent app, but these 2 issues are really annoying.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Gisela Mendez,"The app has great options for transferring and saving. However its horrible based on customer service and accessibility. I had my money frozen on my account for more than 1 month.

Anna Marie Turnage,"Overall I find PayPal to be useful, and generally more secure than using my credit card for online purchases. However, I wish PayPal Credit was more upfront with how long it takes payments to reflect on your limit. I paid my balance in full 3 weeks ago, but my available credit is still only $900; my line of credit total is 1400. It shows a $0 amount utilized/due. If it takes a month for a payment to reflect in the limit, you should say that, rather than telling customers it only takes 8 days",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile

Elizabeth Taylor,"Navigating your history to do repeat payments from the same customer is impossible. I want to be able to go to a list of previous payments, click on the person's link, and be able to request money from them.

Venmo is a much better service in this regard.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
ABackboneandUtilities LLC,"Paypal is a convenient app to send and recieve money but the fees are far to expensive! If cash app can do it without fees on the senders end then PayPal can make it so senders don't get hit with the fees too, or make it a choice. Recipient or sender being charged the fees? I feel you should be able to choice because in some situations the sender should pay and others the recipient should. Also you should be able to collect interest on money that you allow to just sit in the account.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
E. Stan Foster,"You have made it too hard to figure out how and where to transfer out PayPal balances. The route is so obscure. It often takes many trials to find out how to make the transfer. Eventually, you discover that you have to tap on balance in the account. Then, you were led to a choice to transfer the money out. I suspect that the difficulty is intentional, in order to force people to keep balances in PayPal. Not fair. Bad business. Please make the transfer out process easier to find and more transparent. There needs to be an icon on the homepage that says ""Transfer money out.""",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile

raechan t,I've used the app for years to send payments to friends and for purchases. All of a sudden I'm not even able to sign in to the dashboard all I see is a construction cone with a saying that oops something went wrong.

J Landry,"I am not finding any way to contact PayPal about the changes to their mobile app. Maybe they'll read it here. When using the transfer to bank feature the buttons displaying the options for instant and 1-3 days are so big that they only leave a tiny scroll space to select the receiving bank account. There is no need for the dollar amount entry section to be as large as it is. Nor do those speed option button need to be that large. I need to see the more important information - like WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING, more than I need to have the too huge buttons in my way. I've been using PayPal for years. The only issue I seem to have is getting anything resolved quickly. My review rating is about the app. Customer service is a whole other story.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Jillian,"I love the concept and the accessibility and I wish I could give the app 5 stars, but it is glitchy on many levels. For example it will tell me that my bank account is unconfirmed for deposits, yet when I use a browser on my PC it works. It never sent the small deposits for the confirmation. When I go to click on my account after a purchase the app closes immediately. Also won't tell me when I have new money in my account. Overall with display and usability, I find the Paypal app frustrating.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Alexandria mccallum,This app is fairly reliable. I'm a little upset that you can't use their debit cards or acorns Robin Hood and they got rid of their goal setup which was really easy and nice to use when you're trying to save up or budget.

Âè™GR,This new app is basically trash! For me it is slow and clunky. It appears that you have switched from a coded app to a web app (i.e glorified website) because now every single screen needs to load like a web page (and sometimes ask for security credentials multiple times).

Brandy Fahy,"Not at all satisfied with this app right now. I've never had a problem until recently, when PayPal all of the sudden decided that I cant transfer money from my PayPal to my bank account, and now I have a limit on how much money I withdraw at an atm. Trying to reach a csa is impossible. There are no phone operators, and 90% of the car's I've spoken with were as helpful as a new sweater in August.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Joshua Simmons,Kind of a headache having to go back and verify linked accounts and ID after PayPal has collected deposits. I feel like everything sshould be verified and ready for use 1st thing when you setup the PayPal account. I know I was really aggravated when I had money in PayPal but could not use it for anything. The app itself is really easy to use.,3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Joel Austin,"Problem I have is that the app gives you the option to log in using your fingerprint if your phone has that capability. Problem is, when you set it an use it, it will tell you it recognizes your print but, then makes you enter your password anyway. What's the point? Please fix or remove the option.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Chris Fisher,"PayPal is a great app! The only downfall is having a fee for just about everything, so you sell an item on ebay and have a listing fee, end of auction/item fee then a paypal fee for accepting the payment and another fee for using a shipping service. Since Ebay owns Paypal, they are quadruple dipping and could calm down on the fees and still make billions of dollars a year, more people would sell items and they would make more charging less but good luck talking Ebay into charging less money!",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Scott Cantrell,"Youre unclear about things. Sending money to a friend (which is free) or sending for a purchase has no clear way to change it and clicking on the ""box"" does nothing on my version of the app. Im sorry....being in business requires you to create access for your customers to reach you. Its complicated how to contact you for help. Had to scroll around trying this amd that until i finally found the less than easy options. Pay pal can and should do better",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Vivien Dyer,"My two daughters and I used to use this app constantly to pay each other back for things (like groceries, etc.). The time it took to get the money into my bank account was very fast, just a couple days. But lately that has changed. Without warning, it was over 10 days to finally get money my daughter sent me, and of course it was when I needed it quickly to pay a bill. It kept telling me the money would be available in 24 hours... for over a week! Even small amounts ($20-$30) are taking 3 or more days to transfer. We've gone back to writing checks: at least we know how long it will take! Don't use PayPal to send money if you need it by a specific date. The time frames they promise cannot be relied upon!",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Amanda Anastasopoulos,"I received an email saying my money was deposited, it was not. I sent an email to let them know the issue and they replied with an automated response. still waiting to see if I will get this money Edit: I ended up getting no helpful responses from developers. Money was deposited over a week late and they still charged me a fee for the quick deposit option.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Matthew Gafney,"I am having problems loading up to the home screen of this app now. It is the app on my Galaxy S20 that takes longer to load each page than any other. I bet it has to do with the clutter. I am seeing 6-8 cards on the home screen for ads to buy bitcoin, sign up for streaming services, PayPal cash, etc. and every single time I return to the home screen, it spends ~3-5 seconds frozen. I need a way to get rid of the excess noise I don't want so I can see only my recent activity and my balance.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
T M,"Most the time, it's very good. But Have had some issues in the past of things not going through. For some reason a large payment wouldn't come through to me & when asked customer service, was told it was a security issue. But wouldnt explain what the issue exactly was. So 3 stars because customer service sucks",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Merry Lynn Glisch,"Not very user friendly. Financial history is very limited so you can't track and compare payments over a reasonable amount of time. Easy tasks, like ""Make a Payment"" are not easily found, and the Help section doesn't give answers in a straightforward manner. So why do I use this? Mainly for the ease of purchases.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Michelle Schneider,"It was working great until recently. I added a login PIN, but then a minute later it said it was wrong when I used the PIN I just created. It also said I had too many attempts, but still let me log in with password. I wanted the PIN because my winter dry skin makes fingerprints unreliable. This app has too many glitches. I hope it gets fixed soon.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Lisa Pennington,"I have used Paypal for a long time and appreciate the convenience of it. However I am beyond tired of all of the fees Paypal charges. Its almost not worth using anymore when compared to the latest app called ""Cash app"". At least ""Cash app"" transfers funds almost immediately and doesnt hit you up left and right with fees.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Hugo Bounoua,"Change the UI. The app is good but the interface is absolutely awful. All the icons make no sense, I literally have to click on all of them to eventually find the screen I want to be on. Even then it's not really clear. Trash the UI and start all over again with another designer because at this point no one can like such an non-intuitive app. I will switch to Venmo and others if it's not fixed in the future.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Rexhina Kulla,"Usually works well, no issues. The only thing that is really frustrating is when I try to log in, it makes me enter my username and password twice and then the app closes immediately. No error message, no system notes, nothing. Really frustrating",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Leyah Stewart,After making Pay in 4 payments the app indicates the payment still has to be paid. So I made a duplicate payment two weeks ago and PayPal cancelled BOTH payments. This caused one of my Pay in 4's to be late bcuz I thought it was paid already. It's still showing in Red as if I owe it. This can cause my ability to use this product to be cancelled.,3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
lucky powers!,"it's a good app with a good interface, the only problem being not being able to set up a display name apart from my legal name. i want to commission a person but im not comfortable with them know my legal and deadname. make this more safe for business users and trans friendly.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Cotter Polt,This app works my nerves. Hit the back button does way more then you want. If PayPal Credit is so different than make another app. Also. I make payments and still shows I didn't and have a payment due. Then I make another payment. Still shows. Pretty sure there's a way to fix that.,3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Ben Riggle,I never have a problem with this app until now. After the update I know this is a few bugs on the PayPal app. One I wanted to activate my new PayPal card then It ask me to enter my password I went ahead and enter it in but it keeps repeating over and over after I enter my password I think this app is not working properly. I had to go to the main PayPal website and login to my account to activate my card on there I shouldn't have to do that. Please fix the bug issues on the next update.,3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Lihle M,"Can you guys please just make it app simple & easy to use. All these technicalities linking this to that is frustrating. Have one process, simple direct steps, listed clearly before one sets an account. Better yet, differentiate clearly & boldly through emphasis. The different types of paypal accounts a person should select for their needs. Also allow more options for peolpe to indicate their problems or items. Paypal is very selective & thats not a reputable thing for such a global brand.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
A Johnson,"Didn't need this update at ALL. Make a ""Plus"" version for all the folks who want to use crypto or add a savings account. Some of us just want basic PayPal to keep track of incoming/outgoing transactions and to check our balance. No need for all the bells & whistles.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Debbie Dunson,My account is easy to use and transfer money. Although i have been charged multiple times for a paypal fee when indeed its not money from a sale or purchase. Ridiculous... Also the times my account has been hacked and money stolen from it is too many times to count and its next to impossible to open a case in the resolution center. It wont let me do so which it used to... Quality overall has declined over the years.,3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Charlotte Palmer,This is the same PayPal app that I had when I was hacked last year and I could not retrieve all the money from the games that I won and this year they won't let me use my account and shut it down for my safety and I was warned not to post anything on this site because it was not safe and they would find me. I'm very well protected this year and if PayPal can't find me or my account why should I be afraid of some else finding me. Well have a fun a great day but sign up before you play.,3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Richard Tucker,"I have used this app for years without issue until today. I hate to do this here but you left me no choice. The app is currently refusing to load the enter amount for transfer from bank and help pages. They are just blank with the title and back button. It's not frozen, just broken but of course can't report it in app because support isn't accessible.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Eric Pullen,The app is running and it does the job it needs to. This mode of e-check and what not has been a deterrent to business moving in a positive motion. Customer basis for my contracting company have been stunted due to paypal and it is truly hardening my resolution to not use the app anymore. Great job paypal.,3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Jill Valentine,"I had lost all hope in using this app before. That is until this latest update, where I can now delete all my cards without needing verification especially for old cards that I registered that I no longer use. I can also add and edit subscription and have not been limited. So, so far I am trying to use it again but still checking it out if there will be an error again.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Phil Rizzuto,"Fees to send money are absolutely ridiculous and forced apparently. Choosing the option to receive in ""1 - 3 days without fee"" doesnt actually work forcing you to choose the ""in minutes w/fees"" option. The fee to send $1000 is $30 and the fee for them to receive it is $15 for a total fee of $45. It costs $5 through western union for the sender and free for the receiver. Or $.50 for a money order that is also free to cash. Paypals great for some things but absolutely horrible for $ transfers.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Amelia Smith,A few errors recently but other than that Paypal has been really helpful sending money and I feel safer shopping online when Paypal is an option. Payments are pretty fast and effortless. I just hope the recent errors get a fix because I couldn't get passed the authentication stage in a payment the other day and ended up just using my card.,3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Michael Gill,The new check cashing service is trash. I'm a business owner and I get a lot of hand written checks (and it says they will cash personal checks). I was denied on my first attempt to cash a check that was probably the smallest check I've gotten in over a year. Then they think they are going to keep the fee? For what? Ingo did nothing. I want the my pocket change you took from me! I know for a fact this check is good and I'm sure ingo just looked at it one time saw it was hand written & denied it,3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Dizaster studios,"The recent update broke the add money feature a little.

Tony Moses,"The App itself is fine, but the paypal service is terrible, actually shockingly terrible for 2022. Cards won't load, and if they do, money won't transfer. There's no explanation for why anything won't do what it's supposed to do and customer service is totally clueless, just walking you through the steps you already did that you already know won't work. Please, do yourself a favor, and use one of the countless other services out there.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Britnee Hopkins,"Its Awesome! But Its hard to have money sent if you cant confirm your number thats my only issue. It doesnt send the code to my number at all.

"THE MAN OF A 1,000 TRUTHS","Easy to use and reliable, however, the fees are a bit extortionate. And look out if PayPal asks you to update your details. Even if there is no update needed, no change to anything regarding the bank account you've got linked to PayPal, they can make it extremely difficult to regain control of your account. It took me numerous and repeated attempts to do so...PayPal better improve this, and other things soon, or AFTERPAY and similar services will end PayPal for good.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile

I still could not verify my account.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Carolyn Gavin,I left off some of email address when I sent money to a friend and had to cancel the payment when it was still pending instead of being able to correct email address and resend.

Stuart,Had it for years on my smart phones however since the new year Has started having payment errors saying it can't transfer money from current account to PayPal even though I've set up a direct debit to allow it to do so. I resorted to using website which worked fine. Why is it so difficult to talk to some on here for help instead of pages and pages of sometimes unhelpful instructions. No e-mail to contact them but there happy to accept calls costing you an arm and a leg no thanks.,3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
BIGMAN CLASSIFIED,This app doesn't have features like a website version. For example. You can't view automatic payments that are active or inactive so you can cancel.

Johnnie BeGood,"It's an OK app but my biggest complaint is that once you send someone money, you can't see that person's email address, only their name. Unless you are 100% sure you sent the money to the right email address the first time and they haven't changed their email address, you have no way of knowing where your money is really going. They may have changed their address, told you, then you forgot. There is nothing to show PayPal still has the old email address it is sending the money too.",3,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
K.L. Manring,I don't really see where the app does anything more than the website period it taking up space on my phone for no reason and I'm pretty sure I'm going to uninstall it.

Bev Sullivan,It should tell you how much the Buyer protection is because the sellers always ask can you do the option Trust family and friends. But you should the buyer the option to be able to cover themselves as none of the sellers want to pay it as they want as much as they can for the item they were selling in the first place.

Evelyn Eaquints,I changed to 4 stars since it's been very good for sending transactions. My only complaint is that it doesn't actually help non-technical people.

There was a notice that they do this randomly to keep my acct secure but I have to do it every time. Other than that it's great.

They're the first financial company I ever started with, in fact. So I won't be going anywhere. I would and do often recommend PayPal to others!",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Thomas L,App is rife with over complication and glitches. Not as good as it used to be and you may have no problems or a ton.

Susan D,"Most importantly, PayPal is secure & trustworthy. The app is fairly easy to use. My only complaint, and it's a big one, is that PayPal doesn't allow sending money to oneself, like from one of my verified bank accounts to another. I have to add funds to my PayPal balance which takes 3-5 business days, then transfer those funds to myself which takes another 1-3 business days.

RDH,"while the app is easy to make payments with, I wouldn't say it's a intuitive as other apps. I was given a credit on a disputed purchase, but I don't see anywhere to which account it was credited. Also, it occasionally freezes.

Allen Ordal,"The app works well in most cases. There are a few quality of life changes that I think would make it much easier to use. On my pixel 4, I can't have the password autofill from saved passwords, without the app just restarting itself. As I use random passwords, this is a pretty big inconvenience. There is also no biometric support for face unlock on the pixel 4, which would remove the need for autofill to work. I've had no issues other than this, and it is pretty annoying.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Ariana Waite,"I love the convenience. I hate how similar each paypal names and apps are. It becomes very confusing. Especially, if you've researched each one, the names all blend together and sound the same!The app itself could stand to be a bit more user-friendly. I've used a few banking apps and this by far is the hardest to navigate.

JeriLyn Becker-Nager,"This app certainly makes sending money (to anyone..anywhere) very easy, very quick. and hassle free. it also makes it super easy. to receive and transfer funds. . i've used many ""money"" apps but this is the easiest, most secure and most widely accepted.. The downside is if you have a problem or question it's nearly impossible to reach customer service and if you can with stand the 30-60 minutes on hold and actually reach a live rep chances are good that they will be unable to help you.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Frank Hernandez,"This app is nearly everything that the browser version is. however, the ability to create an invoice is missing from the options. there is a round about way to get to invoices if you have previously created one, but I would like to see the invoice function added to future versions. other than that the app is very useful, especially for sending money, which I do on a regular basis.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Alex Smith,"Good App. Works great for family, shopping, and even some bill payments. My only complaint is that funds received notifications have no option to transfer to your bank. Selecting any option from the notification closes the app instead of prompting you to login to continue. This could be streamlined. Maybe leaving the app logged in would remedy that, but that would be a security risk in my opinion. Every other aspect of the app seems awesome. It's a Must have.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Bob Hoff,"The app is intuitive, and includes the functionality I need in sending and receiving money between friends and family. I had not used it for any commerical transactions, so I cannot comment on anything related to those. I could not give the app 5 stars, because the security settings, which include turning on or off fingerprint identification, are unreliable. Regardless of the setting, sometimes the app prompts for fingerprint, and sometimes it wants the password (an annoyance).",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Robert Baker,"Having an issue with the app running a bit sluggish. Started happening a week or so ago. This is the only app on my phone that runs slow and freezes up.

Deb Delk,"While I love the convenience and security this offers, they recently changed the format of the app and I hate it. It used to show your PayPal balance when you open the app. Now it shows the last payment you received and you have to SCROLL DOWN to find your balance. I want my balance showing when it opens. I also don't like it when it changes from friends and family to the protected and charged option. I really enjoy the cash back since I use my PayPal all the time.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Jenn Uber,"Quick and easy way to send money to friends and rent to landlords. Had difficulty locating someone to send the money too one time because I hadn't added them as a ""Contact"" in my phone, but once I did that the person popped up without any issue. Also learned that if you send money twice within the same month, to the same person, the first payment goes through quickly, but the second payment takes up to 5 days to process.

BensoNNicK 16,"PayPal is alright. Definitely does have its upside & comes in handy at times, but also has its flaws for sure. The flaws include: not being able to do simple things, such as deposit from a debit card (that's already linked to the account), bank transfers ALWAYS take 3 days min., and there's ALWAYS a fee, no matter the $ amount or # of recent transactions, etc. In a perfect world, I'd give 3 1/2 stars, but since I can't and 3 seems too low, they get away with a 4 star review from me.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Stephen Hinkle,"The app is easy to use and great for its intended method. I've been using it a few years now, and is still my preferred method of sending/receiving money. Only complaint, and this isnt necessarily with the app, is that with PayPal credit, PayPal only gives the option of paying one lump sum instead of allowing to pay off specific special financing purchases. I've paid more in interested than I'd have liked to since my extra payments go the balance as a whole instead of individually by request.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Joshua Smith,"Decent money app, has it's good and bad, could be a little more user friendly, but transfers after lightning quick and inexpensive, but also they have free options available. Security is top notch, fees are profit killers if you use it with eBay or other merchant platforms, in my opinion.

Heather Keyes,"PayPal is an extremely quick, easy and convenient way of sending/receiving money, paying your bills and making purchases in a safe manner. My only issue with PayPal is that you can't look up someone up using their PayPal link on the app, like if someone sends a screenshot to you of the link. Instead, you have to enter it into the browser. Its not a huge deal for me but it makes it a bit inconvenient. it would be nice if you could schedule payments to be sent out on particular dates, as well.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Michelle C,"The app is pretty user friendly until you get into the individual transactions and learning about your particular terms for the credit account. You have to download the statement. In the classic view, you have much more viewability but have to use a PC for that, not the app. I'd like it if there was more transparency.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
So Phie,"Easy to send and receive money, but if a mistake is made on the type of transaction they wont be able to correct it, for example if the person says it's a payment for a purchase vs just personal, fees are charged and you cant access the money for like 3 weeks and they cant resolve it, so basically you are out of luck if you needed that money right away. Otherwise I just font care for how you find things in the app, it isnt very practical, takes lots of searching around mysterious symbols.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Laura P.,It would be perfect if it had all the same options as the website did and if it would stay logged in on my phone so I didn't have to enter my password every time I went back into the app. I understand why it doesn't stay logged in but maybe make the session timeout be longer like 10 up to 30 minutes. If those things were changed it would make it an awesome app.,4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Lochlan Weichbrodt,"Very useful with good, modern security features, and links well with other institutions. Only draw back is that not all of the features on the web site are available on the app, or even on the mobile friendly version of the website. So if you use PayPal frequently, you would be wise to have access to a PC as backup. Also, access to certain less basic features is not very intuitive, so familiarizing yourself with this app ahead of time is recommended. Still, it is an invaluable tool. 4/5 stars.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Vanessa Montgomery,"I would love to give the app 5stars, but when confirming my bank, the numbers were completely invisible. I tried to see it so many times and it wouldn't show me.

A Google user,"It's not a bad app, but if you have any issues with Paypal, customer service isn't particularly accessable. If I have an unresolvable issue with, say, Ebay, or Amazon, or my stock company, or bank, for that matter, I can fairly easily get hold of support. As they are acting as a conduit for my funds, you can see why it might be important to have a straightforward customer service contact number.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Jon Templeton,"I like the app because it gives an easy way to transfer money to individuals at various institutions. Sometimes the app is slow. I like the cryptocurrancy part and have taken advantage of the ""No fee"" period. I lost a little money because the app was too slow when I would do a ""sell"" at a certain price and by the time PayPal completed the transaction, the price had changed costing me money.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Monica Moura,PayPal can be tough on you when trying to request money. Sending the link through your phone can sometimes still charge a fee if your recipient doesn't choose Friends and Family. I do use it for business though and it's still the safest way to pay and great way to invoice for payment of clients and other vendors. Thank you for creating a great app and website!,4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Mary,"Good app, have used PayPal for years and have never had any issues with transactions. Took one star away because sometimes the app will glitch and not open up. Also, it will keep showing notifications that I have seen already (at times). My biggest issue with PayPal in general is the inconsistent time frame for when a purchase will actually be charged to my bank account. Sometimes it's right away, other times it will be 3-4 days later. Wish it was consistent every time.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Robbie Wilkes,"Gotta drop a star because it keeps losing my pin. I uninstall / reinstall, and it works for a little while, and then stops, and I have to enter my password again. Annoying!

Find myself using it more frequently than expected. Can recommend it, just be aware of the costs. Solid service and secure.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Heather,"Great for paying for items and having the security of not providing your bank information to everyone. The main problem I have it that I never get notified about transactions anymore. No push notifications. When I go to the notification settings I get an error message. So the only way I know something has happened is via email or the person sends me a text. If not for that, would have been 5 stars.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
crHcr21,"Functions inconsistently, I find myself often doing different steps to accomplish the same thing at different times. Sometimes my PIN works to log on, sometimes not, sometimes it shows that my phone is verified, sometimes it asks me to register my phone. Vendor ID's can be vague, but that's across the PP platform. What is does do, it does well and PP notifies you in micro-seconds if you have any transactions. Like before you leave the pay window in the drive thru.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Robert DeMartini,"The reliability is a bit inconsistent... definitely have had some serious situations explode because unneccessary funds being held, security is #1 for all consumers of the application, thats understood, but when rent is due, rent is due. Overall customer service is pretty quick and convenient, and the entire program is truly the ultimate bridge to easy finance processing. Keep up the good work guys, definitely suggest offering some incentives, try refreshing your populace with some promos .",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Lori Felton,"I've only recently started to use PayPal due to an increase in online shopping. I was nervous about it since I knew someone who had a bad experience years ago. Apparently they've improved dramatically. They have had my back with two questionable shopping experiences. I got refunds both times. Thank you! The app is nice although I sometimes have trouble finding what I want, it has worked fine on my Moto g6.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Jasmine Gaddis,"Pretty awesome. Deposits are there and it's convenient to send, receive, and keep track of transfers. I also like da fact that u can have different currencies all in one bank acct and convert them as u see fit. The only downside for me, which is probably operator error and not PayPal, is that it takes u automatically to the app instead of staying on the web page to get into my wallet or anything after I sign in. The only other thing I don't like is with the promos, it took so long to get reward.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
William Weinkauff,Sent my dad some money. He was charged a $72 fee because I failed to notice the protection is for sales and comes with a fee. Make sure you select friends and family if you're paying a friend. It's free but is not the default selection. In the end it was an easy fix. I recommend venmo if you are trying to pay a friend. Paypal is great for other purchases however,4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Sarah Tidwell,"I love paypal, they have a great customer service, I accidentally set up an account on a few websites and couldn't, for the life of me, figure out how to cancel subscriptions, but paypal refunded me the money and canceled out the subscriptions for me. I would rate 5 stars, but I would never ever EVER buy something from walmart with your paypal card because if you need to return it, its like pulling out freaking teeth!! But other than that, I absolutely love paypal.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
B Hermann,"I like paypal. Mostly for the safety and security backing my purchases. The only thing I had disappointment in was paying a service fee when sending payment to my friend for alterations she made on personal items. I paid the fee but I was a little bummed out for having to do so. All in all, very pleased! PayPal makes it easy. I like easy.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
D Yantz,"Overall the app is convenient and easy to use. I've run into a couple problems with verifying my identity. The only phone # it shows on file is one that doesn't receive texts, even though I've updated the phone numbers in my profile. Other than that though, this app has taken over as my regular bank account.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Zethan Monell,4 stars just because of slow response and glitches that happen making it unable to login to my account. Otherwise it's near perfect and gets the job done. I like that the app has made it easier on check outs. Whish there was more of a response time for letting you know something is being charged. I was too late to cancel a transaction I thought I had cancelled üòí,4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Nadia Sobhan,"PayPal is great. Very convenient when shopping online and easy to use when sending money to others. Think the app could be laid out a little better though. I always get confused with the ""credit"" part - is that credit on my account or money I owe on PayPal credit. Not rocket science to figure out lol but confusing nonetheless.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Mike Korpi,"This app constantly opens two different windows for no reason and freezes/crashes every other time, making me have to close and reopen it. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, rebooted my phone, updated it. Same thing occurs. I'm on a Samsung Galaxy S20+, not some random, no name device. Been like this for months. Update: App now opens without freezing, but still opens two windows. Upgraded to three stars. Update 2: The two windows bug seems to be fixed. Upgraded to four stars. Thanks!",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Richard Grudzinski,"From cashing checks, to using my card like a debit card or even transferring money to others this app is great! It does it all with ease! Anyone can do it. Only thing I don't like is that it cost $4 to load which isn't horrible considering that other cards charge $3-$5 to load. I just wish it was a little less. And i hate that they eliminated the goals from there app. That used to be helpful. Other than that it's the best and easiest app for money!!",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Kimberly Biss,"The app is in excellent app. I don't like the new updated app version because it makes it too hard to find things because the other way was easier before the update. Also I had someone hack into my PayPal and spend over $100, and PayPal was able to get me three quarters of that money back and within the week. That was great the only thing that wasn't great was they were supposed to replace my PayPal card and they still have it but yet my account still active so that needs fixed. 4 ‚≠ê s",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Christina Perez,"Convenient and truly appreciate the ability to be able to pay and receive funds conveniently. There is one small issue in that is at the time of making choices to use goods and services or friends and family option. This could be a little more clear, so this is actually a 4.5 star rating. But ultimately love the app!",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
xbyu xrih,"Latest update broke the app. Using on One Plus 7 Pro. Never had issue before. Now when I open the app it loads two instances simultaneously. Using either my password or fingerprint to login works fine, but then when I enter my authentication code it just goes to a blank white screen. It never loads anything after that point. I can still log in on the website, so that isn't the issue. It's the app. *UPDATE* I changed my password from the website and now I can log in on the app again.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
A. Solomon,"Well I've had PayPal for many, many years and never a problem.... Until now! Seems I can't select the amount I want to transfer from my balance to my bank! PayPal transfers the ENTIRE balance. It's happened twice. Then I have to wait until it transfers to my bank, and I have to make another transfer FROM my bank, back to PayPal. This last transfer, I didn't even have a chance to see if I could make a selection! It just transferred without even asking to verify the amount.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Maureen Mellett,"Easy to pay. Last time I paid someone though it defaulted to paying a business and I missed that, so the friend I was reimbursing didn't get the full amount and was asked for a tax id number. I've fixed it for future payments and there was a place for me to review and see this, but prior updates allowed me to choose each time and I was disappointed it defaulted to the business option as I've never paid a business this way.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Michael Krysl,"This app makes online payments almost effortless. My only complaint is that selecting modes of payment should take you to the next screen. The green arrow and requirement to select the next screen is both confusing and needless. A small complaint, though, compared to the usefulness of the app.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Justin Piciulli,Smooth as silk app. I wish I could manage paypal Mastercard payments through it better as opposed to having to go to a browser to do so separately. I would like it of all desktop features could in some way be intuitively integrated in these mobile apps as the product would then have the best of both worlds; robustness of desktop and smooth/intuitive more modern implementation of mobile apps. I don't like feeling features watered down. Mobile hardware power is here now for full featured app!,4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
steph anie!,"This is one of the best apps I use. Makes paying friends, storing rent money, and buying things online way easier and more convenient. Edit: I have LastPass and I've noticed this may be the only app where I can't get the password to copy over after I've pushed the autofill button for my password app. I have to manually copy and paste my password. For that reason I had to downgrade. Still a necessary app for me, and I like having it.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Kimberly Logan,It's been great. The only issue that I have is when they randomly decide to verify a transaction and make you wait 72 hours although you've chosen an immediate transfer. That is the absolute worst. I think they should automatically verify every transaction without the wait which is very smart and even more fantastic for the customer.,4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Jean G,Great app and notifies you when money goes in and out. Generally easy to use. Some complaints - Can't refund in the app. Have to log on online to do it. Friends and Family vs Goods and Services aren't immediately apparent because friends have messed up multiple times and then fees are taken out. Should have an option to undo a payment within a minute or so in case of such errors or typos,4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Yolanda Otero,"This app makes my life so much easier! I minus 1 star only because I continue to experience some issues when requesting from individuals whom do not have a PayPal and they are unable to select ""Pay as Guest"". It gets frustrating. Aside from that I love the security, speed and everything else including Cash Back on transactions!",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
DogandMouse AndFriends,"I love the efficiency of the app and how much it helps with business and quick and easy money transferring. But I don't appreciate being forced to stop what I'm doing every thirty seconds for an update pop-up, especially when I'm already updating my app. Almost tempted me to uninstall. It would be appreciated if something was done to fix this in the future as if it's a common occurrence, I'd rather not use the app as I need to be able to do other things with my phone.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Jessie Christopher,Been using PayPal over a decade. Very solid. Sending money is a breeze. Only one complaint. It takes 3+ days for money to get transferred from PayPal to my checking account. None of the cards I have work with the instant transfer option. Security has never been a worry for me though. Great app!,4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Ty Kaine,"PayPal has been a universally consistent way to send/receive money to/from individuals and businesses for as long as I can remember. It is safe, and easy to use, with no major complaints. Sometimes fee's (mostly regarding business-related things) get to be too high - Especially for small businesses. But overall, it IS dependable.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Maria Smith,"I love this app!! Very convenient to send to friends and family. Make sure before you send money, set your preferences to Family and Friends otherwise it will send as if you're a merchant and the recipient won't get the money until 3 business days. If that does happen have the recipient to refund the money. Then you can call PayPal customer service and they will release the funds right away. I would also like if they would upgrade the look of the app and make it look fancy. 4 and 1/2 stars!‚òÜ!",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Richie Tindall,"It's the best. I just want them to keep pushing and making PayPal even better. For example: Wish I had more than the 4 Cryptocurrency options I have to invest in , but I'm happy with even having any choices at all. Also, If there were ways to make a Help your credit score section. Also, with this they can show pals that can't get a PayPal Credit Card. What they could do to boost the credit score. And more savings options like group stocks that always gains. For long term savings & investing.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Britney Savoy,"Paypal is easy and convenient. I good way to send and receive money. As well keep all your cards secure in one place. I dont like the fact that it takes several days for an ach deposit to show up in your account. When other apps alow almost immediate results. Also, hotel deposits that get refunded backvto your account take days to be funded back to you.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Tony,"Love the app, only thing that would make it better is that if you made a transaction with someone that that person whether it be a buyer or seller, that they could be added to your contacts on PayPal that way if you ever need to issue a refund and vice versa then you would have then added as oppose to jumping through hoops to get a refund or give a refund. Because of that I'm giving it 4 stars",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Robert Guerra,"The app makes paying a breeze, it also allows you to make payments easily. However reviewing purchases seems a bit lacking with information and it can be slow and freezes at times. I also would like more information on certain purchases, since ebay started charging sales tax, it has ran some purchases in two separate charges, one for the item and one for the tax which creates confusion because I am looking for one total and get two different amounts totaling up once I realized it. Overall solid",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Chris Olonzo,"Transferring money defaults to ""Paying for goods and services"". It should default to NOTHING and force you to pick an option. I don't know how much PayPal makes off this little default, but it's deception at the very least. Other than that, its pretty good. Would like to see more PayPal Credit functionality.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Sheri Basulto,"I am a Paypal user & supporter. Love that u can even order a card for free, making my purchases quick & easy! Would give 5 stars but, am not able to add &/or transfer to some of my card/bank accounts, which can be inconvenient at times.

Terry Weber,"Getting started was a real ordeal because the sequence wasn't clear and I didn't find any step by step instructions. The application has been making up for the bad start with the convenience of the one task that I know how to use, but I'm still reticent to try anything new. Updated 10/5/2019 It's still a PITA to set up a second account. I can't find the deposit PayPal says they sent.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Elizabeth Yankee,"Quick and easy, just not able to set up certain things for your Paypal credit card Unless you go online which I feel should be able to be conducted through the app itself.

I don't know why but this happened to me a couple of times last year. Other than that it would have 5 stars.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Jeff Baczkowski,"Had an acct for a few years now. Dipped my feet in slowly to feel it out. But, I really like the app. Most everything is at your fingertips. A few things they could fix.

Only solution was to open it on my computer. This was an issue for a year. I hope it does not come back.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Roxanne Robertson,"Pretty good. It certainly does its job quite well and is very easy to use.

Tiffany L0v3lY Evola,"PayPal is so so much easier, faster, more reliable and then some when compared to others like cash app or venmo.

I'm gonna stick with PayPal myself...forget cash app!",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
yarrow kat,"very streamlined and easy to use. the only thing I'd change is that when you open the app from a notification, you can only see the info related to the notification, you can't click through to your account and then do something, such as move money, unless you close it and open it again from the main icon. Aside from that, it works extremely well and I would recommend it.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Rachel Standridge,"üòÅ but... üò† So far, I absolutely love the app EXCEPT for one inconvenience. When requesting a payment via an invoice, vs just requesting $ with email alone, I had to go to the PayPal website to be able to accept payment. This isn't clear anywhere in the app & when I searched on how to accept those invoice payments, it did state how to do so but did not state that I had to do so via their website. Basically, my money was delayed & I had to spend quite a bit of time figuring it out. üëé",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Terry Leah Procyk,"Pretty easy to use, like some of the updates! like contacts accessability and history look back access. But dont like how somethings just disappeared such as Resolution center?

Just when you think you get the hang of using it completely changes.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
jonathan babcock,"Overall respectable app. Does its job. Always could use improvements. I get bot protections. But solving picture/image problems for AI software every-single-login is not cool. Regardless of my having correctly entered my passwords and login ID. I shouldn't need to solve a short puzzle until after I've made a mistake during login. I will continue to use it, because it works. Regardless of some of the annoyances greed causes.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
M B,"I downgraded to four stars because while I love the ease of use sending and receiving money, the access to your card/account area is obscure all the way in the settings menu.

Victor Larsen,"There should be an option to send money to someone who sent money by tapping the address in the received section. There should also be an option to send money to a bank account in ANY country directly without the need for the recipient to have a PayPal account. I'm satisfied with everything apart from the fees! 20 USD to send 200 USD to another account is so expensive. Considering the total transactions done via PayPal everyday, you're ripping us off.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Michael S. Hafer,"The application allows you to send and receive money easier. Also allows for another method of payment. The technology has evolved to becoming this and I think pay pal has done tremendous work. Although it is tough trying to cash the money from pay pal to another account such as a debit card.

Max Maurer,Has been a reliable app that works well for my business purposes. Mostly use to check payments from our clients and transfer money to our bank.

Concerning re security. Hope it gets fixed soon.,4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Michelle,"PayPal has usually done me right, and the app is easy to use. Been using them for years, and most of the issues I've had, weren't PayPals fault. They would have gotten 5 stars, but had to subtract one because I did have issues with trying to get a prepaid debit card. They told me back in March that they had sent my new card in the mail and that I should be receiving it in up to 10 days from that day. Well it's June now, and I never received it, I canceled it, never received a replacement.",4,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Jack Skelington,I would give it 5 stars instead of 4 but there are just to many features I cant do or cant do easily like I can on the website. The app itself outside of that is truly great.

Jeff Cashatt,"Have used this app for years, completed dozens of transactions between both individuals and businesses / domestic and international, and never once had a problem with sending or receiving payment.

Paegan Messer,"User friendly interface, low transaction fees, check deposits, and debit card feature are my fave things about PayPal.

Samantha J,"Paypal has helped me more times then I can count. In so many different ways. It helps me to pay for stuff without having to put all my card numbers out there and even makes it that giftcards get accepted.

I still use my computer from time to time, but I shop a LOT from bed and if I can pay for something without having to go get my purse and a credit card, which only disturbs me and the cat, then that's my preferred payment choice.

E. Allen,"Makes my financial life much simpler. Auto alerts, no additional cost, for each item of activity. I can send money with ease, and receive cash with greater ease.

Transfers to bank in 3 days, which isn't a big deal as long as you set your transfers at the right time so you can still have money in PayPal but this is if you don't want to pay a fee to send it faster. You do have that option as well. Debit card was super easy to activate. Card is easy to use. In app, it sends money to fellow paypal users very fast and with no fee. Haven't used any other features.

It's convenient and far more private than every other payment app. (But in the early 2000s, I got hacked and ripped off and customer service did not resolve my issues! I had to keep opening new accounts for selling on ebay.) The app doesn't allow screenshots though... Which is comical at best. Another device can snap a picture of your screen anyway! So why not allow me the convenience?!? BTW, screenshots stand up in court!",5,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Corey Gerard,"PayPal sure can have its moments where things get complicated and money and accounts get locked. But, that's banking. And it's 100% online. It has saved the day by being an alternative payment form time and time again. And I've never had any sort of misplaced/miscalculated. It seems the only issues tie to conflicting programs causing things to error out and shut off certain permissions.",5,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Kari Stubbs,"Love the app. It is a great way for me to hide away a little money from myself, but have access to it should I need it. Even though I use it for small rainy day saving and for certain small purchases. I love that they have gone full blown bank account over the years with direct deposit, card, and all. When I get to where I need more it's nice to know it's there.",5,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Jamie Gaines,I LOVE PAYPAL!!! It's so nice to be able to send my family money in minutes!! This is an updated review although there's not much more to say than I really like the PayPal app and use it regularly. I recently used a different pay app due to the other party's preference and I ended up getting scammed! That never would have happened with PayPal and I will be using PayPal for ALL transactions in the future!,5,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Stuart,I find the app pretty decent you can do the majority of what you need in it. Something's I have to get on the pc for which is a little frustrating. That was for personal changes the app just wouldn't let me change them. Like editing my address and changing a card. But overall it does the day to day stuff that I need it for very well.,5,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
gillian goodall,"Never had a problem, super fast at dealing with enquiries . EDITED.. After updating the app like I was told to do so it won't open. I get taken to a page telling me it's time to update the app which when I open it it takes me back to the PayPal open page which then takes me back to the update screen again.. I'm going round in circles.... why fix something that's not broken? I'm now waiting an email reply!",5,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
DJ Hellraiser - Tension Music,"I love the PayPal app and service, it is an extremely handy, easy, and secure way to pay for things and send money to others. The fees to purchase items from overseas or send money overseas are a little high, but not enough to effect my rating. I personally use PayPal for almost all of my purchases and will continue to do so. The addition of the PayPal Pay In 4 option is excellent and very handy and I hope to see it available everywhere soon. I look forward to future updates and features.",5,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Leslie Jaroschek,I love PayPal because the receiver get money immediately and I have never had a problem with PayPal since I started using it in 2016. Safe and peace of mind.

Anne Muigai,Great app. Very convenient making payments when I don't want to give my account details or don't have my card and can't remember the ac number. Love that I can donate when making purchases too. The new pay later option is also very convenient coz it allows securing bookings when one doesn't have enough amount at the time the booking is needed. Very useful upgrades ‚ù§,5,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Jennifer Fenech,Really quick and easy way to send money or pay for goods and services in UK and around the world. Never had a problem with sending or receiving money. Even had one person contact me to say I had accidentally sent a payment to them (do double check the email before sending payments!) - they returned payment immediately.,5,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Ruben Gutierrez,I really like this app. I like the fact that it can be used like a debit card pretty much anywhere. I play a lot of online games with my phone sometimes the payout is in foreign currency and it's pretty easy to switch it over to US currency. I also like the fact that I can switch from PayPal to other cash cards (small fees may apply)..,5,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Patricia Renner,I absolutely love PayPal. Been using it for years. I don't know why people complain about fees. The bank charges fees. Credit cards charge fees. Everyone and Everywhere charges fees.

Jeffrey Beaty,"I have been with PayPal a long time and honestly wish more business allowed you to pay using it at brick and mortar stores.

Wayne Pickett,"I have never had a retailer chase me for money but on two occasions I had problems with retailers, one when the item did not arrive and another when the retailer did not honour their warranty.

Gina D Music,"Easy to use, and it seems very secure. Much more secure than just typing your credit card #s in at any old website. Some websites are fake and only out there to steal your numbers now. But with PayPal it's much harder for them to hack into how you paid. It's nice to at least have a little bit more protection. I'm sure it's not flawless, but it's worked for me so far and I've had it for a while. No complaints from me!",5,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
ariettamusic,"easy and straightforward to use. Just a few wee gripes: It should pick from your previous payees first, known contacts 2nd and then new payees. I sent money to a friend, which I had sent before but because of a mistyped letter it went to a stranger.

My only grip is the inability to interact with cash app and another that's slipping my mind at the moment. Good job pay pal and thank you. Update. Had a lost phone issue resulting in some fraud and like a true to life super hero they gave me my money and back on track. Thanks pay pal.,5,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Avram Neal,The PayPal app is useful when making routine payments to friends and family. The wait time for bank transfers typically aren't that bad. If you don't have Zelle this is the next best thing for security plus support for small banks.,5,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
Charles Lombardi,"This app is phenomenal! The PayPal experience is a wonderfully simple, streamlined way to make payments, keep track of money, and even invest. I've been a PayPal customer since the mid-2000s and their customer service has always been top-notch. The user interface of the app is simple to navigate and easy to use.

Mary Hewitt,Well this app is difficult to set up with online games that deal with prepaid PayPal cards you have to have a prepaid debit card to add to the account before money will start accumulating on your account apparently and I am still waiting on mine to come in the mail. So I would suggest for anyone downloading this app go to Walmart buy a prepaid debit card first through PayPal and get it activated wait for them to send you your new card or you can go on the internet and order it from the internet.,5,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile
George O'Hara,"Excellent. I use it on all online orders. It will charge my credit card on debit my checking account, which ever method I choose. It makes payment after item is shipped so no paid backorder. Easy to navigate app. I have never had an issue.",5,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile

Lindsay Magruder,PayPal is great because it's a secure way to send money where you know nobody can steal your information and you can put annual payments through PayPal so you don't have to worry about them overcharging you or anything it keeps a record of all the payments.

Margo M,"Updated version is better. Although it's pretty similar to Venmo now. One thing I'm a little disappointed that they did away with is the automatic withdrawal into a rainy day spot. I'm terrible at saving and once the money was out of my account I never missed it, but kinda knew it was in PP. I enjoyed knowing I had a few hundred dollars in case anything happened, but oh well.",5,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile

Aminata DEH,An excellent app I've been using this app for years and it never disappointed me. It is easy to use and I never had any problems sending or receiving money. The only thing is I can't sign up for another account with the same e-mail address. I have moved abroad for a few months and I wanted to get an account with the local currency and it was impossible to do so. I hope PayPal will figure this out and improve !,5,com.paypal.android.p2pmobile

Paul Diss,"The app CONSISTENTLY has issues actually using the selected card. Both on the phone and my watch, it just uses the default card regardless of which is selected in the open app. I don't understand the point of being able to add multiple cards if it uses only one. Samsung pay, for all its faults, can at least provide the bare minimum of charging the correct card. EDIT: Google just suggested an article on how to change the default payment; that is NOT the issue. I don't want to change the default every time I pay for something, I want to just select what payment I am using.

The new app is confusing and extremely difficult to set up, and I'm also suddenly being charged for every transfer where I wasn't before. Plus you can't get any help at all! No live chat access and it's been hours since I requested an email response. Totally screwed up",1,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
George Capalbo,"This is about to be replaced with a total disaster of an update in the 'new' pay. Basically standard operating procedure for Google these days. I have no interest in transferring money to friends, or deals or banking. I just want to get it my credit cards and passes as I have in the past, with an added layer of security and contactless payment. All that is now hidden and the new app doesn't even show you store cards when you are in a store as the current one does. Epic fail.",1,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Chris k.s.,"Wasn't at all convienent in the concern of time took me an hour to figure out because it isn't at all easy to set up. When it was finally set up, it didn't work like the instructions told me. It seems more detailed help and instructions actually could make this option useful, otherwise, it falls under the 'uninstalled and useless' apps. If this is the best 'digital wallet' app for Android users, it is a very long way from being simplistic, easy or quick.",1,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Steve,"Used the old app for years, flawlessly. Tried the new app twice for contactless payment. Both times I received the checkmark on my phone indicating that the payment was successful, only to be told by the cashier that the payment didn't go through. Each time they had to cancel the transaction in order for me to insert my debit card. Quite embarrassing. Going forward I definitely will not be using this app.",1,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Aja Gaul,"The new app is such a downgrade. It's far less intuitive. It appears as if people I have previously sent money to no longer appear contacts, I guess because they don't have the app,and I'm not even sure where to request money now. I have now tried to verify my debit card three times and it still won't, despite having the same card attached for years.

Sam M,"Everything about the new app is a step in the wrong direction. 1. UI stutter on page swipes. Not a good look for Flutter. 2. UI inconsistencies: Pulling down on your user logo switches accounts in other apps like Maps, Keep, Gmail. Not in this one though. Also, why do some of the toggles switch on and off in the initial view render? Why isn't the state locally saved? 3. Doesn't follow material design guidelines.",1,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Amy Jo Bruno,"Will not work for in store payments. Yes my phone is compatable and it says it will work, but it doesn't. Update, I've decided to uninstall it. I won't use it enough anyway.

Lida Afrika,"All transactions should be funded into accounts immediately or the option should atleast be available. Your method is scam friendly and a very big inconvience.

Steve Mitchell,Hasn't worked last 2 times I tried to use it. It's unreliable in general and a lot of stores either don't accept it or don't understand how their machine works.

It's so unreliable I'll probably just stop using it.,1,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
BharathRam Hariharan,"Auto pay without the user confirmation is really a bad feature.   Last week I was at whole food and I was browsing my phone near the bill counter, it automatically deducted the money from the card in google pay when I actually wanted to use another physical card.

Convenience cannot be justified when it comes to security.",1,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Trey Heyward,"I was told how great this app is, but it sucks! I've tried using it at supermarkets and banks and it either didn't work or it took so long that I ended up using my card instead. I live in New York City and they're implementing a cardless way for us to pay for our transit rides with our cellphones or tap our cards, the last thing we need is to standing waiting for this app to work while we and others behind us are all rushing to get to work! New Yorkers are not always patient!",1,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Kevin Reed,"App was pretty good and generally reliable until September, then it abruptly stopped working and all attempts at reloading the app, removing and re-entering information and payment methods have been in vain.

Malachi Marquet,I'm just going to buy a bike. Not intuitive at all. Setting up a card required me to call my bank to get it authorized.

Gary Seetge,I've had nothing but trouble using this app. Nowhere does it have an area to go to to remove a credit/debit card for transactions. It obviously CAN be done but you really have to dig for the information as to the procedure. I had a credit/debit card registered which was compromised. Registeted a new card.

Google might want to review the app security structure as their own products conflict with each other where alternative software does not.,2,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel

This is particularly irritating when trying to work out if a contactless payment has gone through, as it doesn't e.g. show as 'pending' so you're unaware until it's been processed and appeared.

It's doing contact-less payments, membership wallet, friends & family payment, MINT, rewards, send money to India and Singapore, order food, feed the meter, etc. Maybe the super apps are the future but I wonder what's the usage pattern data of all of that.

So I had to change my phone's default payment method from Google Pay to another, bank-specific, app, which allowed me to pay via NFC successfully. Everything worked fine yesterday - the only thing that has changed since was that my phone (Samsung Galaxy S10+) has been updated to Android 10.

There isn't a reason that the use of it on a watch must be tied to the ability to use the watch as a payment device. Now I need to get an entirely other app just to be able to use the passes on my watch.",4,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Adrienne Pashote,"Super Easy! love the app! the only reason I give it 4 stars is because you have to lock your phone once u set it up. I'm not one to lock my phone. I understand the security of it, but I feel like it would be better/more convenient if the lock screen came up when you're about to pay. other than that, would recommend!",4,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Giving Back Hope,"Only used the app a couple of times so far, but a quick review of the limited experiences that I do have with the app is this; adding your credit cards and the necessary information along with your loyalty card information was quick and easy. I don't have any retail, brick and mortar, reviews to give because I haven't actually used it inside of a grocery store yet or anything like that. But I have used the app at check out shopping on the web.. and again it was quick and easy to check out, a breeze and all in all a good experience payinh with the Google pay app installed.",4,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Madeleine Shopoff,"Super convenient once it's set up! it can be a little confusing to get it to read at the register initially, but once the app is all set up it's really handy to have. I can put all my gift card info here instead of keeping cards around and trying to remember to use them, and don't always have to bring my wallet everywhere to make purchases.",4,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Jake Jakubson,"I love using this. It is one of the top three reasons i stay on the google platform. The app is easy to set up and use, and I trust the security. The only reason it isn't a 5 star app for me is that stores are still resistant to allow you to use it. Even if they have NFC terminals, it returns a ""not a valid account number"" error and I have to end up pulling out my plastic card. I use it every time I can.",4,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Daniel Negrete,"Google Pay is pretty dope however much like it's fruit rival it relies on a technology that isn't widely accepted by other vendors. However, that doesn't take away from the app's amazing layout and functionality. Load your card(s) is as easy as one two three. If you're lucky you'll get a sweet Google play credit promo.",4,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Alanzo McIntosh Jr,"I love the app; the interface is clean, simple, and easy to use. The app stores most of my cards, gift cards and all; though my main bank thag i have my checking account through is not on the list. So id love to continue to see banks added on a more frequent basis. My other critique would be that I would like to see this app become more than just a wallet, but also a place that I can do budgeting and see expenses in a way that I qould via Mint, Quapital, etc.",4,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
M B,"Love the app. Slight problem: even though I arranged the cards in the app, when I go to pay (long press power button), only the default card is queued correctly. The next card in line isn't the one I listed and I can't get to it without showing all cards. The convenience is in being able to swap cards with a swipe.",4,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Scott Stone,Was the Best way to pay however it started going down hill when you couldn't pay directly from the contracts now it's being replaced with a new app that sucks and charges to use when you transfer the funds from your Google pay balance to the bank. I will no longer use it when that happens and this no longer works Too bad it was very convenient and I used it for a long time. To bad greed has to come into play when they had a good thing,4,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Keith Castellano,a bit of a hassle when using my primary debit card in this wallet because at a lot of locations it doesn't automatically use the card I have to choose an option either debit or credit which defeats the purpose of tapping and going. Also at certain stores it's invalid because that option isn't available. So this app is better I believe for just credit cards and not your bank card because except I don't know but it stops it from working. Overall the app is designed well other than that flaw,4,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Mark Hyden,"So far Google Pay has worked as advertised; I use it just like my regular bank debit card, which I stored on the app via a simple 2 step verification process via my bank, 30 seconds and I was ready to go. Anywhere I can use NFC to pay including with my Fitbit, Google Pay is my go to app. Easy to pay online as well as automatic payments and every transaction is saved in an easy to read report. Havent sent money or tried split check option so holding back a star.",4,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
B C,"Interface is not straightforward and cluttered but, came in very handy when my card didn't work because of a malfunctioning chip. Also a nice feature where it adds to your rewards card at the same time. Would be a very nice feature if it saved a copy of the receipt. I realize that would have to be worked out with each merchant though.",4,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Eric,It's good but the only complaint so far is spotty verification on some of my cards. I had to repeat the verification and confirmation process over 5 times in two of my cards before it got through. Can't blame it on Google for it as it could be an issue with the issuing bank on their poor tech but Google could at least provide more specific error messaging than some generic one,4,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Alicia VanGordon,"Once the cards are set up it is a great app. I've had some issues getting my cards verified.

kris greene,"Since my phone updated to android 12 my cards in the Google pay app are automatically deleting themselves. I have deleted and reinstalled the app. I have cleared all the data from the app and have rebooted my phone. Can you please advise what action to take.

Dean Lewis,"PROS. At retail stores,Woolworths Rewards, Myki transport card in Melbourne, online payments and adding payment fields in chrome or Android shopping apps on the fly - perfect! CONS. It isn't great on WearOS. New international app doesn't look like it's coming to Australia any time soon. ALSO! When paying for a Myki top-up, it's a pain, needing to verify my ID twice. Where it counts, essential and necessary, a needed app.",4,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel

Peter Kaytes,"Suddenly and without any warning, contactless payments no longer works with the reasoning that my phone (Samsung Note 9) no longer meets the security requirements. Huh? Meanwhile the device is not rooted, is not modified, is Play Protect Certified and hasn't had a firmware update. In fact tap and pay worked just fine on Jan 9 and the last patch was Nov 2021. Very strange.",4,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Steven Law,"I would have given a 5* rating if it were not for the following issue. Since the start of covid I've been shopping for two relatives that both use the same bank as I do.

This could cause me to pay using the wrong card.",4,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel

I would like to see more security options and I really would like an instant on-screen summary of what you have just paid (when you see the tick) I know I can get a receipt but I often don't and some newer card machines don't display the cost.

Yen-jou Teng,"It's very convenient being able to just tap and go when paying for small purchases, especially for people like me who has like 20 cards in their wallets.

It's a feature available on Samsung Pay, which I really like.",4,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Winston Huang,"Fast and convenient way to pay. This app gives you the option to turn ON NFC in the app if you regularly turn it off to preserve battery. However, it does not allow you to turn it off after paying. Although this is something minor, it does cause the user to go through the settings to turn off again, hence the 4 stars. Otherwise, loving the app!",4,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Jonathan Tan,"When it is working, it is a seamless process. However, I have a major gripe in that whenever the app is outdated, I am unable to use it. Unlike apple pay where it is in-built into the OS, Google Pay is a separate app that constantly requires an update. As I set my apps to be updated on WIFI only, there were many instances where I could not tap my entry onto a train/bus and have to stand awkwardly at a corner of the station/bus to update this app whilst trying not to hold up the line.",4,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Niki Sharp,"I really like the app and it works almost everywhere. I just wish I felt more secure when paying online, such as if it asked for biometric verification just before a payment is finalised.

Kayon Walker,"It doesn't have PC optimum points as an option. Paying with my phone is ok, I had a few temporary issues, where it wasn't reading. Max attempts it took to read or ""connect"" was 3.

Dev Preston,"An extremely handy app! I'd like there to be an easier way to turn off NFC from within the app. At the moment it prompts me to switch it on before making a payment but then I have to go into settings a couple of levels before I can switch it off again , both for security and for maintaining battery power. It isn't the fastest app open, so remember to have it runnin before you approach the contactless check out. Be prepared that some shops may not give cash back unless you use a physical card.",4,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Justin Rondeel,"The app is works very well and I like it a lot. The one thing I wish is that there was a setting to adjust where it works from.

Anthony Phillips,"Excellent application, instant notification on payments integrated from multiple accounts. Clear information, ready to set up and use.

Michael Brown,"Good app, has some shortcomings, the inability to label payment cards puts it behind Samsung Pay somewhat. The inability to create custom loyalty cards when what you have isn't available in the app can be quite frustrating. Especially because Woolworths Rewards is such a great app, but my backward state uses a seperate rewards card to the rest of the country.

Victoria Kolm-Isleman,I was very impressed by this app. The idea was very wrong and dangerous but the day came when I was forced to take it seriously and I was glad that I had. I first used this app at a gas station somewhere between Portland OR and Olympia WA almost a year ago. I don't remember annoying advertising so my guess is that it doesn't exist. Anyway I do like having a good backup plan for my payments. Running around with a bunch of cards seems much more difficult and dangerous. Just be responsible.,5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Pam Baldwin,"Updating a previous rating (from a 2). As a result of the 2 rating, Google reached out to me and through a chat session, they worked with me until the problem was fixed. I was very impressed that they reached out, worked until fixed and then checked back to be sure all was well. And yes, the app now works like the previous version did.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
William Coniam,"I have been wary of these services for years, thinking they were unsafe. I finally did my research into the security of Google Pay and was surprised to learn it's actually more secure than a typical credit card. I also thought it would be annoying having to do extra stuff at checkout and open the app, but I just used it for the first time and it was very easy. Just held my phone (unlocked) to the terminal and it was done immediately. Definitely easier than a credit card.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Geophrey,"I Love having the ability to store all of my loyalty cards, especially because I keep my coupons on loyalty cards!! Just open the app, find your card, and there it is. No need to fumble through many different apps trying to find the store you're at, then signing into the app, (if you even have internet at the time), then trying to find where in the app your loyalty card bar code is at, etc., etc., etc. As far as I know, you don't even need to be connected to the internet to use this app in store. Just pic your card, and it's scanned into your account and letting you use coupons you've previously added to your card. It's great. Not sure about payments, yet. Still figuring that out.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
BlueFalcon 82,"This app is great. I have had only one problem and it was not even really a problem. It turned out that my ""problem"" originated from my credit union having very strict security standards. After that was identified, it was fixed, all is well and the world keeps on spinning. I would absolutely recommend this app. It's fast it's effective it's easy to use and it's a google service so it's free and works with everything else google, everyone already has. AWESOME!",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Jessica Klingel,"Used to be quick and simple, but now it NEVER works the first time. I unlock my phone, make sure NFC is turned on, hold my phone to the payment reader and it gives me an error requiring me to scan my fingerprint and hold the phone to the machine again. Very frustrating and wastes time. Edit: Thanks for the quick response! I am happy to report it is working again on the first try. Simple and quick!",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Alexis Williams,Most definitely one of the best money transferring and payment apps by far. No fees for any transfers and you don't have to wait days to receive your transfer. Money automatically goes into your account and usually within seconds to minutes! When paying at a terminal it's as easy as tap and go. I love this app and I use it all the time. Kudos to Google for actually caring for us customers and not trying to make a quick buck off of us.,5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Suman Hosmane,"Works well with payments.. no complaints. Only issue with the store passes. Though there is an option to keep all passes in one location, some of them don't scan in the stores. Not sure if it's the screen brightness that throws off the reader in the stores or something else. Fixing that would make the app even more ""featureful"".",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Nick Sinchak,"It's actually surprising how convenient this app has been. Case and point: I recently left my wallet at home by mistake and hopped in a cab to get to work. After I realized my mistake and a brief panic, I was able to pay for the cab and all other transactions for the reminder of the day with the app because I had imported all of my cards - corporate cards as well. This app has been a lifesaver!",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Kyo Mocho,"Amazing! I was surprised how quick and easy it was! It's actually much faster than swiping a physical card, especially where you have to use those annoying chip ones that take way longer to process; with Google Pay, it instantly goes through with one tap! I'm impressed! And I love how you don't even need to have the app open, you just unlock your phone and bam! Super cool! New technology rocks! So convenient and fast! I also love how you can store membership cards too! Every place should have it",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Justin Lee,"There is nothing wrong with the old app. The new app ends free instant transfers, and adds a 1.5% fee for debit to debit, with free bank transfers via ACH. Why would anybody want to upgrade to the new app when functionality and features have been taken out? If I wanted to use an ACH transfer I could do so through my bank or elsewhere. I hope to hold onto the old app as long as possible, because I won't be paying for transfers in the new app.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Stefan Hauge,"Great app. Very easy to use, the hardest partis putting in your debit card and verifying it (this is only more difficult with smaller banks because it requires a phone call). From that point on whenever you're at a place that support google pay you unlock the phone and hold it next to the terminal, no need to open the app.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
DREDD Dr,"Okay, I NEVER rate apps. However, my wife took my debit card from my wallet and I needed to make a purchase. Already standing in line and running late for work, the app was going to take too long for me personally to run it through my debit card. But with the option to run it through PayPal, which I already have an account for, took no time at all and it worked like a charm. Overall I am extremely happy and hope that sometime in the near future all merchants of all types start accepting and working with Google pay. The only drawback that I have is that it requires me to have a password on my home screen. But that is just my inner laziness talkin.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Sam Wight,"WOW is this app good! Literally the simplest pay experience I've ever had. All you do is unlock your phone, hold your phone up to the reader, and that's it! Setting up the card is a little bit less quick than with Apple Pay (I had to call my bank to confirm my card), but once it's set up, it's leaps and bounds ahead. You can also send money through the app like Cash App or Venmo, and it deposits it to your bank account instantly, for free! AND it works with Google Assistant. 10/10 great app.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Kelly,"The epitome of convenience and probably privacy invasion. But I always get a small discount when using the app - you can't beat walking up, waving phone, choosing item and walking away. Because I'm already logged in via biometrics on my phone, o login, no PIN required to make a payment. If I lost my phone, they couldn't use this because they need my fingerprint. Fast and easy.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Robert Jacaruso,"It is a well functioning mobile payment app but I wish theyd move the ""offers"" (advertisements) to their own tab making the default tab the payment cards only. Its annoying that on a payment app the actual credit cards are only about 1/4 of the screen, the rest of the page being filled with things like ""Get a $25 gift card now from..."" etc. But, its come a long way and is catching up to Apple Pay with additional features such as being able to add boarding passes.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Shadow Gaming,Best electronic payment method. I use this app everyday and the only reason I would rate it 4 stars is just because I want to see it being upgraded all the time but there really isn't much to be improved it's just works. and that's kind of all that matters I guess but even the interface looks really good. also I've never had a problem with it and if you are having a problem with it hold it sideways to some cashiers and that's the reason why.,5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Matthew Phillips,It is very convenient to have all my payment methods other than cash available on my phone. I have also been able to make use of the membership card information not only for it's intended purpose but I stored order guides for work in it and was able to perform regular tasks on the fly. I also like that I earn double rewards. I get perks from using and paying off my credit card and by accessing it with Samsung pay. I have had an issue with their rewards redemption but it's still very useful.,5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Suzanna Armstrong,"I love this app. It makes it super convenient to pay for things without rummaging through my bag. I heard there's a fee for credit cards, but I only use my debit card so I don't worry about any fees. Also, the app automatically gets you in touch with your bank. All around I like this app very much. Maybe it's different with multiple cards or credit cards, but for a debit card it's amazing",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Amir Singh,"It works really well. I have the Google Pixel 3XL so I don't even have to open the app to pay, which is really convenient. My only gripe is that I can't switch cards easily outside of the app, which makes sense, and isn't Google Pay's fault. Overall a perfect and convenient way to pay. I like this much better than Apple Pay.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Robert Reiss,"App was very easy to use. Took no time at all. All I did was unlock my phone, which I have to anyway from when its been off and then hold the phone to the top of the card paying device and it does all the rest. My suggestion is to not put too many payment methods in Google Pay at first. Start out with like your major/default bank debit cardvand your major/default credit card. The more you get used to how it works, the more money paying cards you could add.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Justice Franklin,Deciding to finally leave a review since google has decided to get rid of the superior app in favor of something more bloated and convoluted. Being able to send money by email was a highlight for me but now with the new app they HAVE to have the app installed. Selecting a contact or even being able to enter in the information manually was so easy and simple to use. App was great. Now I have to find another app for transferring funds.,5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Ashley Dumaine,"Way better than the new app. I liked actually being able to get money sent to me deposited straight into my bank account. Now it goes to my ""wallet"" which I have to cash out. Transfers on this app are way faster too than the new one. Funniest part? Play Store won't let me review the new app even though it's installed to actually voice these concerns. Classic Google killing off a great app to replace it with garbage (with a worse UI just like with YouTube Music). Way to frustrate your users!",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Chuks Ozodi,"I have been using Google pay for a few months now, and it's super convenient, even more so than Samsung pay. no need to open the app, as long as the phone is unlocked it works. For larger parent additional information is needed like the pin or your fingerprint. The setup was easy enough because it used the information from the cards on my google account, all I had to do was finish the in-store set up, and there are an increasing amount of places supporting nfc transactions.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
A Google user,"I wish more places used Google pay. It's way safer than actually pulling out your card and swiping it. I've had my card compromised 4 times just from me pulling it out and someone getting the numbers off the front. With Google pay there's no chance of that. Plus if you set it up with a third party such as PayPal, none of your information is ever shared with the seller. This is the way of the future. Not to mention most phones now are finger print protected, which adds another layer of security.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
A Google user,"Fantastic. the experience is superior to Apple's. Two things I love: 1) the ease of adding cards, and 2) the fact that all you have to do to pay is unlock your phone - I like that as peace of mind and a single fingerprint to pay. Apple's double or triple tap to bring up payments on lock screen was always hit and miss.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
David Sollars,"This App works Great! It always has. The new GPay, which will replace this version, is horrible! It's clumsy, awkward, slow, has way too many steps you must go through to achieve simple tasks. Requires you to login when opening the App, and asks you to login again to make your payment. Totally ridiculous. You might as well use your card for a much faster transaction without all the unnecessay steps.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Willie Owens,"I have been using Google Pay for some time now and have had all very good experiences. In the past I used PayPal but had a bad experience and have been using GooglePay every since. I even use it to make in store purchases as well. With its virtual account, it keeps all your personal information safe for the transaction. I have not had to use it for a refund yet so I cannot comment im that aspect. However, I would definitely recomend this to all.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Dean K,"The issue has now been fixed in the latest update. Thanks! A recent update changed the paying experience for the worse. Now from an unlocked state the phone will not automatically pay. It requires an additional fingerprint scan or pin to pay. Why do i have to scan my fingerprint twice? Once to unlock the phone and another to pay with Google Pay. Also, some payment terminals do not handle this so well which adds even more delay.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Will Vang,Worked every time I used it. The no security prompt when using the app is new to me but I guess it's still secure as long as your phone isn't unlocked. I would of liked the option to have one though just for extra piece of mind. I haven't experienced any errors and transaction notifications have shown up right away.,5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Ryan Barone,"I started trying out Google Pay and Apple Pay recently and I find Google Pay significantly easier. I just unlock my phone and hold it near the payment device. Done. Apply Pay requires triple tapping the home button, clicking ""enter password"" (unfortunately doesn't allow fingerprint for this), entering the password, and then holding it near the device. I'm really looking forward to more places having contactless payment options -- this is faster and easier than using the card in my wallet",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Rob Overton,"We use Google Pay all the time, with a single credit card. It's much faster than using the chip, doesn't require that we open the app (only that the phone is unlocked) and provides a record of the transaction, right there on the phone. Best thing since Google Search.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Mushroom Toadstool,"Litterally a life saver. I left my credit card at a restaurant and on my way home needed to get gas and this let me pay without it, which is so amazing.

Philip Saville,"International travel purchases made easy! I've been trying to use a USA credit card in UK. Without a PIN code, many places don't work and I've had to figure something else out.

Aimee Oldham,"Once i figured out how to get the app working, I've loved using it! so my phone case was blocking Google pay from connecting to the credit card readers, which is really weird but also kinda cool. now i don't have to worry about my info being stolen while my phone case is on. back to the app...super easy to use, very convenient and i really like that it uses a ""fake"" credit card number when using it, for extra card security.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Kenji Fox,"Okay I gave Google Pay a good few months as a test drive. I've been through all kinds of funny situations with half working readers and grocery stores with spotty internet. I've never been double charged, and everything works fantastically when the store supports NFC correctly. This has become my number one preferred method of paying for goods. Both physically and online. Renewing my auto insurance is a two touch dream from my Progressive app directly to Google Pay. I will be happy when this becomes completely standard at all POS locations and websites. I also accept Google Pay and other contactless payment options for my own business. After dealing with it from both sides for almost a year I can say with confidence that it's a win for both parties. If you've been afraid to try, or putting it off for any reason just do yourself a favor and jump in. It's safer than a traditional card since each transaction generates a one time use key rather than handing over your bank or card info.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
A Google user,"Google pay is a pretty flipping cool service. From a privacy stand point its much better than that RFID tap to pay thing (from what i can tell), its also real fast when i go to McD's and order on the new touchscreen thing. The only downside i see is not everyone is using it so if i dont see the sticker on the window, or the little icon on the verifone credit card terminal, im just guna guess if they use the service or not so sometimes i just hold my phone up to the reader and nothing happens./s",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel

For those having the ""cards that used to work fine can now not be added"" (because you switched to a different phone) and keep getting that stupid error message in app and online, reach out to them.

Obviously it would be better if the problem didn't exist at all, but their support team actually managed to help and fix the issue. Cards add fine as before now.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Asko,"Excellent tool, but these things would increase the quality; - possibility to change the order of cards in list, I just payed with the wrong card by accident. Because my debit card was first on the list and the reader read it from a far. - optionally to have to press a button to activate the NFC broadcasting of the card. Otherwise a neat experience",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Masta Haze,"It is that good. The trick is to keep it simple. Add a card, or more than one, turn on NFC directly from the app, pay, done. I only wish Google can bring this payment system officially in Japan as well, and make it a widespread payment system. For now, especially in Japan is very limited. On the fidelity card tab tho, it's still behind some other very specific app that provide more possibile cards (specifically Stocard).",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Nico Gheorghioni,"I don't know why I read all this negative reviews. For me, this app is working perfectly. I have absolutely no issue with it.

Of course it's propriatory software so not every third party app appears here and of course Google is taking care of Google and everything every one of their apps does is geared in that direction but you have to give them credit.

David Struff,IDK why there's this one and the other similar version of this app that seems to not do as much as this one. Contactless payments work with this one but the other one tells me my expensive phone doesn't meet security requirements.

Angie Morgan,Trying to use this on my Samsung galaxy S8 plus but says it is currently updating but it worked fine on my other phone. Is it just a problem for the phone I am using now.,5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Anthony Duncalf,Great app which I use all the time and it uses a virtual number so the retailer never sees my pin number. My only issue is you can spend up to the contactless limit without unlocking the screen. The contactless limit in the UK is being increased to ¬£100 so someone could spend ¬£100 or more (until the pin is required) if they get access to my phone. I would like the option to disable payments without entering a pin. I know they could do all this if they find my bank card but I think the ¬£100 limit is ridiculous so if Google enabled the pin or fingerprint feature for any amount I wouldn't take my bank card out at all.,5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Vamsi OSS,"This was really amazing app from Google. Even it is different from India and here, i Iike both the versions.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
James Monroe,Works perfectly most of the time and if you fill out a review and you don't get paid instantly you are usually paid within minutes,5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Jason Robillard,I'm not too satisfied with Google Pay app because I'm trying to add a payment method which I cannot because they want me to verify an account that doesn't exist anymore and is impossible to verify the only way I can add a payment method,5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Konstantin Stoyanchev,"After last update on Samsung galaxy watch 4, gp doesn't work. Before the update was no problem, now i cannot add any card. Try with reset of the watch reinstall gp - no change. Please help.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel

Michael Golf6,"I put Google Pay on my cell phone yesterday.  Today I used it at Lidl and it worked easy, just hold my cell over the terminal you usually use for a card and zap it was done.  Then I looked at the App and it had recorded my purchases and said where I'd been and how much I'd spent.  You have to try it !  It's the future. Like Garlic Bread LOL.  PS Note, Google Pay uses a ""virtual card"" to make the transaction and didn't give Lidl my real credit card number. So it's actually safer.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Cleruzinek Ambiver,"I have only been to one place that did not support NFC payments and only accepted contactless through magnetic stripe. In other words it's pretty ubiquitous where I live. I use it for easily 90%+ of all transactions and never had a problem with it. It's actually one of the very few Google apps that work properly, the rest is unfortunately pretty hit or miss bar few exceptions.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
David Brewer,It's so convenient to be able to pay any amount of money quickly and not have the ¬£45 limit. I wouldn't go out without it. I'd like to alter my review. Google has suddenly told me I haven't got a transaction history!! I've tried to get some help and instead of being able to talk to some I have some random algorithm telling me to look in my transactions. I've looked they're not there. Help Alter again!! I've deleted the app and reinstalled it. Why couldn't some body/thing suggested that.,5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Vincenzo Corbo,"so far so good. tried just for fun and it actually worked. I initially tried without unlocking the phone and, of course, it didn't worked. once unlocked, payment has been fast and secure: i got the notification in a bit. Since the payment was below 25‚Ç¨, the POS didn't asked for the PIN, I don't know if it will for payment greater than 25‚Ç¨.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Gautam Suri,"Makes paying for goods and services so easy! The option of selecting from the various cards I own is effortless. I love the fact that the history of payments is readily available so I always know how much I paid for something in the past. With a Pixel phone, I dont need to worry about turning my NFC on. I would really like if the limits on transactions be increased based on spending patterns. I would love to tap for higher than $100 in a single tap.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Donald Thomas,"Just launched for my bank here in New Zealand, so have to use it a bit first before seeing what I think of it. But so far it works just fine. However one thing that I noticed, was that it listed under the what's new and the main description for for app, that you can send and receive money within the app. However sending and receiving money is only available in the US and UK. Yet nowhere in the description does it state that it is only US and UK. This could be confusing for some people who think a feature is available when in fact it's not, so Google you need to add to the description that sending and receiving money is currently only available in the US and UK.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Jesse Haas,"I have never had any issues with this app for the past couple years. However, all of a sudden my phone doesn't seem to register that the EFTPOS machine/paywave device is close and it doesn't give an error or anything. Even after discovering this issue it still works on rare occasions. The problem could lie with the fact that my Pixel 2 is more than 3 years old now. Not sure.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Lunar Lupine,"Very handy for me as my debit card isn't contactless and it makes some situations, like scrambling around for bus fare, easy to pay for. Just add as many debit or credit cards as you want, set a default payment method and it's ready to use. All you need to do is unlock your device, don't even need to open the app!",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Josh Holloway,Brilliant app. Great for people who like to leave their wallets at home or at work. Works really quickly and instantly sends you a reminder telling you have had a transaction. I have used it on the underground short delay but does the job. It is contact less only so you can't use it for transactions 30 pounds or more. Alot of security was involved which is good in case a stranger had my card but took a while but I supposed that depends on the card you have. Overall perfect app for me.,5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Marius Augustin,"Google Pay makes it easy to pay with my phone pretty much anywhere (at least where cards are accepted). The interface is simple and attractive, easy to understand and absolutely serves the purpose. I wish some reward/gift cards were integrated a bit more tightly (e.g. Starbucks because if I add my card as a gift card, it doesn't automatically adjust the value, if I use the physical card or their app once and if I just add it as a rewards card, I am not even sure how it works.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel
Aiden Wilson,"Great way to keep all of your payment cards and account/s in one safe, secure place. Easy to pay for purchases both online and instore or for purchasing subscriptions, apps, music, movies, books etc. It is also a secure place for storing loyalty cards and also a great way to send and request payments. You can also keep a check on your Google play balance, payments and subscriptions. I have been using it now for over six months and it has no instability or compatibility issues with my smartphone.",5,com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel

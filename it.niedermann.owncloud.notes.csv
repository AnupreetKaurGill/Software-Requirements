Miakoda,"Stopped syncing. Removed account and readded, no go. Uninstalled and reinstalled, no go. Couldnt find support. App became useless.",1,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
A Douglas,Does not even work. Error is immediately thrown that username and/or password is wrong. Which is not right. I'm self hosting my Nextcloud instance and have no issues. Simply did not work for me.,1,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Timothy Hoogland,Doesn't work with the latest NextCloud update. Getting a file api error.,1,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Florian Gibala,Sadly it cannot be used with self signed certificates. Please add support for this.,1,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
A Google user,Trying to connect to owncloud instance using ssl with a certificate signed by GoDaddy fails. Every time. Purchase refunded.,1,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Peter Szabo,"Without the features of a 21st century notes app, such as supporting check lists, tables, inserting pictures etc... this is nothing else but a simple text editor. I know this is mainly an issue of the server side but still, the usability is strictly limited and doesn't meet the requirements of a note taking app in the year of 2019.",2,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Landon Wark,Latest version refuses to sync.,2,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Josh Stuckey,unable to login 2-factor authentication.,2,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes

Anton Kro,"Would be nice if the Certifcates genrated by Let's Encrypt will be accepted, for me is this app for now not usable :/",2,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Phillip Clapham,"Missed that is currently unsupported with self signed certificates and ended up wasting 2.50, not worth using until is able to truly to be used on a self hosted domain at home.",2,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Philipp Bartels,"There are several server side note applications available. This Android app sadly only works with the server side ""Owncloud Notes"" app but not with the ""OwnNote"" App. The server side ""Owncloud Notes"" App isn't really feature rich (no WYSIWYG, no categories, ...). Its not that big App fault but the limited features make it just not helpful...",2,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Tom -,"Love that you've made this... However - it was buggy enough for me that I had to refund. The unordered lists sometimes looked like ""·-"" and sometimes like ""-"". It happened when I synced from remote with `-` style unordered lists and was inconsistent enough to the point where I couldn't trust it to work If you fix it I'll give it another go 🙂",3,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Ju-eng Ling,"Man, has that app and nextcloud notes in general come a long way since I tried it last! It can actually be used for note taking and note management now. For that 👍👍👍! And yet, no support for attachments, not even a simple picture, let alone locations, videos, etc! Until this is possible I can't give it more stars. Also, because of those shortcomings, I can't use it as my main note taking app. Too bad, really!",3,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Rene Balvers,"Good and really needed/valuable app in conjunction with nextcloud. However, the selection of text is cumbersome. The interaction needed to select, cut/paste parts of text is not easy. At least not as intuitive as expected. Nice is the ability to position the cursor accurately, but how to switch from insertion point to select text, e.g. by dragging the screen, or switch from selected tekst to a selection with handles to extend/reduce selected text is vage. Would like to elaborate on it more.",3,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Heikki Moisander,"It works better than some time ago. Did not use it much yet as my next cloud activity is on pause, but I am looking forward geting it up and start using this as my main note app.",3,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Alex Fornuto,"Pretty good. As a feature request, I'd like to be able to ""check"" boxes while in view mode.",3,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Chris Zuber,"Would get an extra star for image and links, and another for check marks (with the ability to toggle without going into edit). Still pretty useful.",3,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
A Google user,"The app is a very good idea to sync notes with nextcloud. But it's described as ""renders markdown"" and cannot even display tables. Update: I'm long term user now and besides comment above, I'm very pleased with stability and usage experience.",4,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
My Android,Excellent Notes app to use with your NextCloud instance! Improving with each release. Keep up the great work. 👍 ---> To dev: Would you consider importing some of the security functions from EncryptPad (no mobile app available) to secure important notes with an open source implementation of an AES encrypt/decrypt function? I believe that would be great feature and hope you will consider it. Danke!,4,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Matej Cotman,"Hey, nice notes app! Missing one little feature to be perfect: in the note listing widget I am missing first few lines displayed below the title of the each note, something like Google Keep has.",4,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Sipho M,"Hi, thank you this app, it works and is convenient. One question : for a few months now the context menu does not pop up when I highlight text, what could be the issue? Phone is a Huawei P20 Lite.",4,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Wolfgang Matzek,"Very nice app! At the moment, ransomware recovery must not be installed otherwise the app does not synchronize. Very kind and quick support by the developer!",4,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Garrett Mills,Excellent client. It does most of what I want. My only request would be that it seems too easy to delete notes. It was the first thing I did on accident when opening the app.,4,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Aaron Bauman,"Really enjoying the app, but do find the lack of clickable check boxes as a downfall. Definitely 5 star capable if that were available!",4,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Jack Torrance,"works pretty well, thanks! please make the widget more like the google notes widget, with previews of the note.",4,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
A Google user,Seems fine so far. Current complains: you can't click a checkbox in the rendered view.,4,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
GM G,Appreciated though not cheap to buy. Source/privacy confirming no talk back (auth is directly performed by this app!) Categories are not present on the web version of NC Notes A mini howto in the about/help section could be useful as a pro memo for formatting,4,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Simone P,Should be more like Google keep with the possibility to add pictures and set reminders,4,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Dan Reid,"Edit: re-evaluating at request of developer, will be adjusting review and rating shortly. I appreciate the follow up.",4,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Borivoje Petrovic,"The proggie needs, since it supports md, linking of images and showind them in the preview mode, via md syntax.",4,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Anthony,"Good app. Not the most feature full experience but is solid in doing what 
it needs to. I would recommend this app for keeping simple notes. Keep up 
the good work! It's on its way to a 5 star app for sure.",4,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Salaros -,"Good. 4 stars just because it doesn't show file previews in plain text format, instead of  rendering the actual Markdown, there are plenty of libs for that, please add this feature",4,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Domi Cz,It's simple and does what it should do. Password protection would be great ;).,4,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
A Google user,"Simple and quick app. Similar to ""myownnotes"". Markdown is great. Swipe to delete is a good feature. A quick-note widget would be nice to add.",4,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
George E Thatcher,"Nice easy to use Nextcloud app. I use other Notes apps on NC too, including Joplin and Carnet, but would much prefer to use an Outliner if I could. After some initial teething issues on the Server side, the syncing is working like a charm. I fully support the work of external developers operating in the Nextcloud space, like Stefan. Great stuff.",5,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
D AB,"Great app. Very easy to use. You need to have Nextcloud Notes installed on your server for it to work (the app could give a user-friendly warning about this, but I contacted developer and within minutes he replied. ). One suggestion would be to allow to encrypt notes, if possible to be compatible with QOwnNotes on Windows.",5,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Toby Heywood,Absolutely brilliant app! One thing I'd like to see in future versions would be native conversion to PDF and/or the ability to print the formatted fruits of my labour. Still use it pretty much everyday and don't see that changing anytime soon,5,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Jørgen Sirhaug,"Good, and simple app. Does exactly what it says, and I haven't experienced any issues with taking syncing notes. Five stars if I get the option to create notes as .md by default, and not .txt. Edit: Exceptionally quick answer from the developer. Thanks!",5,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
robert toth,"Excellent fast and reliable. It doesn't push you to adapt your self to app as many apps do. It just do what is needed. I use it for long time flawlessly. Due my ignorance to new version of Next Cloud I cause a problem. Developer reacted instantly on my e-mail even it was Saturday evning. Although I didn't provide what developer asked he managed to give me full support and resolve my problem. If Google would have same seriousness in production and respect to customers, life would be nice.",5,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Andy Milne,"This app seems to have had a huge improvement since I tried it a few months back. Now this is the perfect companion with Nextcloud as a google keep replacement. The search function across all folders is great. Maybe adding search across all accounts would be great if possible? All credit to the developer, you are doing a fantastic job.",5,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Ian Davies,"This is one of my favorite apps, used almost daily and I would be lost without it. However...Connectivity seems a bit hit and miss, with no obvious way to view any logs as to why. Web app works on the same url. The option to view and change account settings without having to delete and recreate the account would be nice",5,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
David Swanson,Love it. Easy and simple to use. Hopefuly soon you can add images and or voice recordings.,5,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
K&K Service Team,"Issue is now solved, app working as expected in full scope of functionality. I should have been notified about installing and enabling the Notes app on my server to begin with. Suggestion: A gentle reminder for the end user to have it installed and active on the server side before attempting to log in for the first time with the client. This can easily avoid frustration.",5,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Andi Mayer,"The last update added markdown table rendering, I'm really happy with this app now and will use it as my main notes app! In terms of navigation, I'd prefer to use the back button to get to a categories overview. Currently you have to press the hamburger menu button on the top left, which is hard to reach on bigger phones. Open a note -> ooops it's the wrong one -> press back once closes the note -> press back twice closes the category and opens the category overview would be better easier.",5,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Agu Tómpa,Lost all my notes recently with error message 'exception'. Contacted nectcloud but no solution except with the information that lot of people reported similar issues with cloudamo server. Can you please check whether the issue is same with the rest?,5,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Paul Walker,"Clean, intuitive interface to Notes. Great list and note-content widgets. Dark mode is awesome. Recent background refresh option adds 15min, 1h and 6h refresh intervals which are perfect for my use cases of sharing lists with family and updating notes from my computer browser. Developer is very responsive!",5,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
"Sira Vachatimanont, account_Gmail","The app created duplicated notes i.e. 'note', 'note (1)', 'note (2)' instead of updating the note when I tried to edit it. ---> Problem solved, it turned out to be the problem of the server I subscribed. Thanks for great support from the App team.",5,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
James Randall,Excellent. If you have nextcloud this is a drop in replacement for Google keep and exactly what I was looking for. Would be great to add customised note backgrounds (like keep) but really that would just be cherry on the cake.,5,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
Benjamin Blankertz,Open source app to manage notes on your nextcloud storage. Works great. I like the checkbox functionality in view mode. Great-to-have for the future would be support to display images with the usual markdown command.,5,it.niedermann.owncloud.notes
J,"Not only do I love using this app as my note taking app of choice, what made me want to leave this review is the phenomenal developer support.

A. L.,"This is one of only two reviews I've made online--not just on gPlay--ANYWHERE. Because this app is perfect and the PRO version is worth every cent. The clever little touches--the ""undo"" bubble that appears for a sec (punz) after deleting a memo; appending multiple memos to one gDoc; setting a default Evernote label; one-tap sharing--no more opening the menu+hitting Share+ selecting OneNote/DropBox/etc.+hitting Ok--just type then tap, et voila! It's in the cloud. Amazing. THANK YOU, DEV!",5,com.editoy.memo.onesecond

A Google user,"On desktops, Workflowy is the best nested list application available for any system - I'm so happy somebody remembered that there are users who want complex lists, unlike all the other ho-hum to-do apps. But for my longer lists, it's much too slow on my stock Android 8.1.0 Nexus 6P. Important features missing on mobile: 1) Scroll long lists smoothly (the alpha features do not help) 2) Integration with Google Voice Assistant ""Take a Note"" command via Android Intents 3) Widget to take a note with voice 4) widget to take a note with keyboard 5) reasonable loading speeds on mobile. For the web app there are 2 improvements I strongly desire: 1) In the context menus I would add ""send to list"" to allow user to send the note to the top of the list of their choice (example: send to list > groceries) and 2) allow a backspace at the start of an indented line to concatenate with a previous line as currently works for a non-indented line. Update 07-31-2018 Guys can you please give us a widget to quickly enter a note? Workflowy is great on desktop but the Android app is just too slow.

Looks good, but I require regular auto backup and that's behind the paywall. £50/year for premium is too much - I'm not a business, I'm a private individual with no income. My budget's more like £10-15/year and that's what I'm currently paying for a rival task manager.

Chris Waterguy,"Seems to have improved, but still a bit laggy. But no reason to use this Ap, as HandyFlowy has more features and is at jest as wick, and just opening the website in the Pyrope browser is much faster than either (and has night mode).

I do wish there were check boxes next to each item so that we could quickly ""complete"" tasks with one tap instead of two. Google Keep allows you to hide/unhide checkboxes. I also with there was a widget that let me have a window into one or all of my lists. Hope the Android app keeps improving at the pace the web app is.",3,com.workflowy.android
A Google user,"For whatever reason, tagging works horribly on my phone.  I've tried both the stock keyboard and SwiftKey keyboard and anything I preface with ""#"" or ""@"" never resolves correctly.  EXAMPLE: In SwiftKey, if I type ""#tag"" and hit space, it gives me #tag#tag.  If I do the same with the stock keyboard, it automatically removes the hashtag.

Johnathan,I hate that everything is software as a service now. It's so annoying. No one should pay monthly for a list app. It's ridiculous.

Turjo Turjo,"Good app but i think developer should care about improving the UI and also add some widgets. I think UI can be better.

In my phone, though i have only 3 tasks (not fully used my screen) i am able to scroll. Scroll an empty space. I don't like that.

Lars Antrack,"Simple but genius. Not as feature rich as other note taking or task managing apps but the idea of an infinite document that can zoom in and out and let's you share each section with others is just awesome.

Some features I would appreciate: reminders, calendar integration, markdown support, attachments, tags overview.",4,com.workflowy.android
Henry Todd,"The defining feature is the infinitely zoomable outline, which works well in the app. It's a great companion to the website.

I wish it supported markdown.",4,com.workflowy.android
Mori Faye,"This is exactly what i needed. It's easy to add things and move them around. other todo apps seem to have a whole song and dance to add a task when I really just need an outlined list.

Arjun Raj,"Four stars for the idea. It is supposed to be infinitely nested lists. But those who are here for a free app be warned that only 250 bullets for free per month.

Mark Pezzo,I really like the web app (which is what I use 99% of the time). The only thing that bugs me is that you can't always combine two bullets by deleting from the beginning of the second one.

The core functions all work smoothly on desktop and mobile and I rarely encounter bugs. My needs are very basic (nested lists, synced across devices); I recently upgraded to Pro just to support development. I use the Android app, iOS on iPad, desktop on Mac, and browser in Firefox (occasionally Chrome).",5,com.workflowy.android
A Google user,"Over the past two years, this app has become the rock solid core of all I do--Simple to use, totally reliable, I've written a TV series--and now am drafting a book on it--collaborated with others, and am founding an organization using it--all this as well as managing my calendar, commitments, weight and money. Now am not sure how I ever got by without it. Yeah, ""make lists not war""--and while your at help maka difference with your lists!",5,com.workflowy.android
Christopher Jones,"This is the app I had always dreamed of. No exaggeration. It's the ""one ring to rule them all"" for data entry, data storage and organization, all in one. If you also use Google docs (including spreadsheets) and Evernote and web links or anything else, it can all be tied together into one seamless, re-organizable, fluid system right here. It's exactly what you want it to be, no more, no less.",5,com.workflowy.android
Ruth Bearse,"I discovered this app about 5 years ago and ever since it remains one of my top 3 favorite & most-used apps (and I've always had a *lot* of apps on my phone). I've tried at least 15 other list-making/productivity apps and this is the only one that's actually made a (huge) improvement in my productivity & is simple yet functional enough to stick with. One of its best features is its ultraportability, since it immediately auto-syncs to all of my devices and is super easy to use on my phone. 10 ⭐!!",5,com.workflowy.android
Warren Schoder,I've been using this app for years and IT IS TOTALLY AMAZING ! Simple and straightforward yet powerful in capability. The heirerarchical structure is probably its greatest and most unique feature as it enables almost instant access to scads of data and notes you've recorded without the need to open & close files. The design of this app gives the user the ability to tailor it to his own preference and style. Basically no learning curve as it is amazingly free of needless clutter. BEST FREE APP,5,com.workflowy.android
Nadav Savio,"What makes WorkFlowy unique is that it's ultra-flexible without being complicated. You don't have to learn any new concepts because it's simply an outline like in a Word document, but the combination of a basic bulleted outline with #hashtags and a few very subtle interface controls means you can organize pretty much anything you want. Plus it syncs across devices. Well done!",5,com.workflowy.android
Jeff Gordon,"Workflowy (app & browser) is easily one of the most important tools I've ever found for outlining, logging, note-taking and on and on. With infinite levels of hierarchy + ability to zoom just to the task list (etc) at hand + instantly search and see filtered view of whole or zoomed in segment, I can instantly retrieve notes I took since day 1 (which was pre-2012!) I lost my brother 8 years ago, a WF keyword search I can find so many memories i logged. It's free unless you want frills. WF rocks.",5,com.workflowy.android
S B,"Elegant, streamlined, with no unnecessary bells and whistles to distract and detract from the core offering. Good native apps for mobile and desktop. Might be nice to have the ability to download multiples so it can be moved into different accounts on the same phone. Haven't tested the sharing/collaboration feature sets yet.",5,com.workflowy.android
Kevin Wall,"This app is great and gives me exactly what I need to not only keep my thoughts straight, but to also give them cohesion and flow which helps me flesh out projects. Simple design, easy to use, and does exactly what it's designed to do with ZERO bugs in the last 4-5 YEARS, which in and of itself is pretty freaking amazing! Great job!",5,com.workflowy.android
Kabocha Mirai,"Thank you designers of workflowy for making a simple, yet deep and powerful tool for organizing everything that comes out of the mind. Brilliant! One thing though, if there's a local page search option, that'd be more convenient. I find myself going to Dynalist when I'm writing scenes in different books with the same tags...",5,com.workflowy.android
Stephen Robinson,"WorkFlowy Keeps It Super Simple. It is a simple hierarchy bullet system with side notes. You can use hashtags to help you find buried notes. Everything is collapsible and expandable. Both the Android app, and the PC browser version work flawlessly. I would highly recommend WorkFlowy to anyone. It is a Flawless Gem! It really does help you organize your brain! :-)",5,com.workflowy.android
Nico Greenarry,"This app is such a pleasure to use. I learned about it from a podcast interview with the founder, who explained, (I'm paraphrasing) ""Workflowy allows you to create bullet point lists with the ability to nest infinitely deep. When I explain this to some people, they ask, 'Why would I want that?', and others say, 'Oh my god, I've been wanting something like this for years!'"" I fall into the second camp. I already have my own system for keeping track of all my priorities and to-do list items, so I thought I'd just dip my toe in the water. After less than a day of using it, I already knew I'd have to switch everything over, despite the effort involved. Besides loving the central premise of the app, which allows me to scope out a project to an arbitrary level of depth, there are just tons and tons of really well thought out details. Here's one example: You can type ""now"" and hit tab to convert it into a date. Likewise with other human-readable date strings like ""noon tomorrow"" or ""next month"". So it's really easy to record the date something happened. After using Google Docs for my project planning and Todooist for my to- do list, it's a real pleasure to use something that's set up for deep project planning. I'll still use Todoist for date-based tasks. Workflowy has some features meant to make it possible to do things like repeating tasks, but that's clearly not where Workflowy shines. But I'm happy to be paying for the premium version of Workflowy to get a really well-designed product.",5,com.workflowy.android
Kate Kelley,"I really enjoy the flexibility of workflowy and the way it is easy to incorporate to do list style planning with more detailed notes on tasks. Probably the only thing I would like to add is a built-in way to create recurring tasks, but overall this is a great tool. The simplicity and flexibility is great!",5,com.workflowy.android
Jaden Prendergast,"I'm a full time student and work full time. I use workflowy for everything from keeping track of my coursework to my to-do list at the office and project management. I keep track of my favorite restaurants and coffee shops, quotes that spark something, my workout schedule, an intense brainstorming session, etc. I love the sentiment of ""organizing your brain"" because thats exactly what it feels like.",5,com.workflowy.android
Jacob Brown,"Super well thought out. A few small bugs, but I love the setup so much I don't even care. Few improvements I would like to see: multiple home pages; the ability to 'swipe' on items while they are activated",5,com.workflowy.android
Nathan Seiling,Great note taking app. Was a pro user until could not sync on my phone (my file was too big). Generally recommend it for most people. Moved to Obsidian but wish it functioned more like the Workflowy entry ease and clean interface,5,com.workflowy.android
Heather Katsoulis,"Brilliant, simple, effective. I'm an organizational obsessive, and Workflowy really lets me try on some ideas and tweak easily. So happy to have found it. Thanks for a great app and such thoughtful improvements.",5,com.workflowy.android

Damilare Adepoju,Loving it! For Desktop Hope to be able to select and drag texts in note to reposition. Keep a note expanded at will for comparison with another note.,5,com.workflowy.android
YourDudeBk,"Great app, I use it to take notes in my science class. The usage limit for the free version is a little annoying, yet understandable. I definitely recommend this to anyone who's interested.",5,com.workflowy.android
Luddy Harrison,"I have been using this app for years. I try many other organizers and to-do apps, but keep coming back to this one. suggestion: make an Android widget that keeps a selected list open so you can glance at a todo list without having to open the app.",5,com.workflowy.android
Francesco Martire,"Nothing beats this app and its desktop & web counterparts in terms of productivity and elegance. The more I use it, the more is part of my professional workflow.",5,com.workflowy.android
Jahirul Islam,Good app with lots of functionalities. Would be better if it directly supported markdown syntax.,5,com.workflowy.android
PANOS MEDIA,Super easy and clear layout. Does exactly what I want.,5,com.workflowy.android
Murali Madhavan,"After testing WorkFlowy for nearly a month, I've gone Pro. The subscription cost looks high, but when you have the app installed on your Windows PC, Android phone and iPhone and iPad, you realise that the annual payment is not on the higher side. I find WorkFlowy to be wonderful for capturing ideas. It's such a pleasure to use. You take notes more often than before. It's worth paying for.",5,com.workflowy.android
A Google user,"The best app for tasks, lists and notes. I'm using it for years and can't really imagine organizing my personal and work-related information without it. Both the mobile app and the desktop version are easy and intuitive to use, yet powerful enough to allow the management of anything from simple lists to complex projects.",5,com.workflowy.android
Robbie Brown,"As one who was once officially (for Court purposes!) diagnosed with ""chronic organisational capabilities"", this app has helped me more than any person, device, strategy etc to keep my life humming along in some semblance of productive and creative order. I have it installed on all my devices and can keep all my various lists (e.g Shopping, Wood-working, changeover tasks, to do, and so on) right up to date in an easily shareable way. I can also cut and paste sections to all my other apps in outline form and format accordingly, Absolutely brilliant; a fond and ideal companion for any creative and/or systems thinker!",5,com.workflowy.android
Eugene Kiver,"I use pro for several years now, I think it is one of the best productivity and structure apps I've seen. I miss the ability to share topics from my phone though, and due to keyboard shortcuts I prrfer desktop version. But having a good phone app is one of the reasons I use workflowy daily. For me workflowy has been one of the best investments so far.",5,com.workflowy.android
Priyabrata,"Best app to write and organize your thought. I wrote everything here and you can access the content from everywhere. Syncing is one of the best feature. Also you can easily export the content to him pages, copy the contents to Gmail easily. Loved the app. Go for it. It's worth trying. Team have put lots of effort in this.",5,com.workflowy.android
Jawacode,Great lightweight app for to do lists and organisation,5,com.workflowy.android
Marko M,"By far the best note taking app and website I have ever used. Intuitive nested headings means that you can keep track of infinite detail, and still be able to simply look at the bigger picture. Can't recommend it enough. If it can ever handle pictures I'll give them my kidneys.",5,com.workflowy.android
Antonio Gerundio,"Easy to use, and thought processes are enhanced.",5,com.workflowy.android
Blessie Faith Maynucas,Literally the best notes app! I've been looking for note apps where u can attach files and this is just dope! It's pretty functional and this makes me feel more productive!,5,com.workflowy.android
Marcy Ganow,This has been a great tool for long term organization using nested lists and tags. The new ability to view information in grid is a boost.,5,com.workflowy.android
Caluã de Lacerda Pataca,"I've been using this tool to organize my personal and professional life since forever. It just works™: the features are all finely tuned, and as you get the hang of them Workflowy starts to feel like an extension of your thoughts as they form (more so on the site than on the app, but the small keyboard doesn't help here!)",5,com.workflowy.android
Jayalakshmi Vaidyanathan,I use this to understand my work flow with other departments. It is super useful,5,com.workflowy.android
Justina Bur,"It's all I need. I find so many ways and spheres in my life where I can use it. That simplicity helps you to make things organized and not to create too many things as it happens with other todolist apps to me. Sometimes I think to myself that it's not enough for something and choose different app, but after some time I come back because all I need is here. 🖤",5,com.workflowy.android
Wandy Hermanto,"Workflowy is great. But please add functionality to attach the picture from media, not only directly take a picture",5,com.workflowy.android
Viktor Mastoridis,"Excellent app for organising busy and complicated brains. The initial blank screen is at first scary, but then one realises that WE CREATE (and modify) our own organisational method, whatever it may be and look like. Undisturbed by unnecessary features, the mobile app is a very good companion to the web app.",5,com.workflowy.android
Robert White,"Very good. Have a lot of notes in this application. Using it for work as a knowledge base, keep all my to-do notes in priority and nested order, plan Christmas presents, keep a diary, and generally run my life through this application. In principle it is quite simple but the features enable easy organisation of hierarchical lists, which make it a powerful tool for me.",5,com.workflowy.android
Jake Potts,"This app is awesome! I've been using outline format to organize tasks for years. I even used to do it on paper 🤣. WorkFlowy removes any friction for organizing my ideas. I can drag, drop, open, collapse, zoom in and out easily. I love it.",5,com.workflowy.android
Kate Hellenga,Infinite nesting! Simple interface. Easy access across devices. What's not to love?,5,com.workflowy.android
Nicolas Pipard,"Used it for years. It has a Great availability, works well all the time, and the new functions like the images wow!

Tom Matlock,"Endless, flexible, minimal: this is the ultimate note-taking and data structuring app. Ive used it since 2015, its constantly getting updates, and it's replaced Evernote completely and 90% of my OneNote usage.

Aditya Srivastava,"Great App exactly what I needed! Few area of improvements that can just make every one forced to use the pro features - Give a Widget support like Google keep ,scrollable option to add or edit - One can use Pending tasks node and if one is able to set reminders or alarms on individual tasks and whole node - Bring Google Cal support to set alarms and events for planning day with Day Plan node. - Goal Setting node can have some templates - Long term goals - Short term goals Looking forward !!",5,com.workflowy.android
Vlad Alive,Best knowledge base keeper software - both mobile and web. With infinite number of nested folders/nodes. With a great option of sharing small pieces of content via a link.

Simon Morris,This has been my go to note keeping app/website for years now. I'm a software developer and mainly use it for keeping track of product ideas.

Alex Prima,"When I need to write or structure my thoughts, this is my way to go app. I like using WorkFlowy first in the desktop. The app is simple, but I see myself - the way my mind thinking to get things done - is evolving when I used the app on daily basis. I forget my Word processor or simple note apps. I just jot down my random thoughts and later happily structure them.",5,com.workflowy.android

Dylan Westfield,"While other todo apps strive for complexity, WorkFlowy takes a refined, minimalist approach. At its core is a giant nested notebook, a fractal sprawl of notes/notebooks that provides a simplified framework for scaffolding around ideas. This is bolstered by features in smart annotations and navigation that allows personalization of layout and workflow, resulting in organization that better captures the nuance of mental hierarchy and focus than traditional lists. Great for personal workspaces.",5,com.workflowy.android
Nemo McLovin,"I wanted an app as close to pen an paper as possible. I don't like having to go to my phone when I'm trying to stay organized because I'm a very serious information junkie. This was the simplest app I could find, and it paid off the first time I used it.",5,com.workflowy.android

Things that make mobile todo apps usable like swipe quick actions (e.g., swipe left to complete task, swipe right to reschedule) are missing.

Nezaminai Kazuro,"Used to be 5 stars, but with each update, more crazy gets added than good. For example, the latest version changed all the icons, and with very poor icon choices. For example, the icon to edit a note is the ""escape"" icon that normally means ""to exit out of current viewspace."" Further, the controls have gotten MORE clumsy by adding a new bar that wasn't needed and shifting controls to that bar, and then getting rid of long-press controls.

Christopher Robin,"Good looking with lots of features but unintuitive and frustratingly slow to use. ▪Saving to SD opens up possibilities for local sync eg with 'Syncthing', with which it works beautifully. In fact the whole syncing side of this app seems really well thought out, and is a primary attraction.▪Love the dark theme.▪Font size - I find the notebook lists font too large when compared to the notes font, it would be great if font size could be chosen separately for notebook lists and note content. ▪It's very unintuitive and convoluted to change or edit anything, this is particularly annoying when trying to change 'State' which should be a one tap option. The complexity of trying to change anything is the main reason I don't yet use it for real. ▪Would like an option to create a homescreen shortcut to a notebook. ▪Would prefer that it didn't have Internet Permission, syncing is perfectly possible without. :-) Now has hyperlinks, and has got rid of empty ""Notebooks description..."" - thanks.",3,com.orgzly

Initially couldn't figure out how to add subnotes till I figured out the difference between short tap and tap and hold.",5,com.orgzly
Connor Rhodes,"Org-mode on my phone This app allows me to read and edit org-mode files on my phone. I sync them with sync thing and edit them with this program. It's interface allows me to fold and unfold text in a mobile interface. It does not support all of org-mode's advanced features, but the developer is gradually adding support for more and more.",5,com.orgzly
Iud,"It's the best app for todo's I've tried, and it's smart, the fact it syncs with dropbox automatically allows to see and edit your notes in the pc (although that's also thanks to the org format); [REQUEST #1] Allow to set event hours without a reminder (optional reminders) [REQUEST #2] A calendar integrated to the search results, for example, at the top (if enabled for that search query); it would be so cool to have in my ""Agenda"" search query [REQUEST#3] Allow to sync markdown/.md files!",5,com.orgzly
Ilia Tsvetkov,"Oh, I love the app. I tried different Todo apps, but none of them worked for me, but this one is just great. Special thanks for not doing the subscription model. If there would be a pro version, or ""But me a coffee"", I would be happy to do that",5,com.orgzly
Maikol Solís,The app is excellent. Git support should be added to better handling conflicts with the notes.,5,com.orgzly
Володимир Снігур,"Functional, simple, does one thing but does it good, no-frills app, no ads, offline as far as I can tell. In general what I need, however there is one thing... lets say I want to save notes, set up sync with local folders: phone memory and SD card. Orgzly recognizes only one of them (whichever was used in previous sync session). So it is ""either/or"" and not ""and/and"" situation. Don't know if remote directories are affected. Android10 Samsung Galaxy A6 (2018)",5,com.orgzly
Hello,"A masterpiece in UI design and friendly to the user with its exportability by the simple fact that it exports straight to text. It also comes with every feature you'd ever need, but without overwhelming you. It has really helped me organise my life and I warmly thanks the developers for their tireless work to make this a brilliant app. They may not think of as a wellbeing application but they should, as it helped me remove disorder from my life and I hope it helps others to do so too.",5,com.orgzly
Karl Reeves,"Amazing app! Thank you so much for creating and maintaining this. Works perfectly and I appreciate all the features, despite someone complaining there are now too many features. Only improvement, for my use cases, would be a calendar view for scheduled tasks as an alternative to the current list view, which is something we have in org-mode.",5,com.orgzly
Arjun Raj,One word: AMAZING. Infinte nested lists are great for documenting ideas as they come. Orgzly is fully free and open source. Thank you so much to the developer.😍 FEATURE REQUEST: 1) UNDO BUTTON 2) make the + icon to expand note a little bigger & may be put it inside a box or a circle to know the touch area. Accidental touches are in general a problem. May be swipe down from the plus icon to expand the note would be better.,5,com.orgzly
Mateusz Dudzinski,"This app is amazing. Very fast and reliable. Sync works really well. I had some trouble with setting a Dropbox sync at first (just FYI: it was a problem with a browser in which Dropbox login window was being opened, setting default system browser from FF to Chrome solved it for me). Non issues with the app whatsoever. The only wishfull thing I can think of that would make the app more magnificent, at least for me, would be to open ics files so that it'd create a task with due date etc from it.",5,com.orgzly
x y,"Perhaps the best outliner out there. It would be useful if one could put a subtree directly into the system clipboard (implicitly converting the subtree into a plain text). Currently, one has to export an entire outline to a text file and copy the relevant sections from inside a text editor (as far as I can undrestand).",5,com.orgzly
Июльское Утро,"could you make the widget as minimalistic, beautiful and customizable as in com.stuff.todo? just take a look. those typefaces, adjustible margins, roundable corners and no header (at least you could allow to hide it). also it possible to mark something as done with one tap. please, I'm begging. that app has so little functionality, but so beautifully made.",5,com.orgzly
Sk Sinha,"I personally find this a wonderful app. Very intuitive and well structured as long as you read the user manual carefully. It does what it says, although there is immense potential for more features, I would personally like more options when it comes to fonts, sizes and colours. Apart from that, this just made my life easier.",5,com.orgzly
Tai Groot,"Great app. I'd love to see org-drill implemented into it as well, and maybe the option of Google calendar sync, but only if it doesn't break any current functionality because as is, it's awesome! Also: Drive sync, archiving, and attachment support! Oh, and inline todos support please.",5,com.orgzly
William Tracy,"This app is fantastic for something Free/Open Source. (There's not even any ads!) My only complaint is that reordering and reparenting notes isn't very discoverable. A note in the Getting Started notebook would be very helpful. Again, this app is excellent and I highly recommend it.",5,com.orgzly
Wang Ding,"Excellent and useful app for me! I think auto-merge maybe a very convenient function when one needs to edit org files on both pc emacs and mobile Orgzly, and force-downloading from dropbox or force-uploading from local storage is not secure when sometimes a file is both edited and one I forget to update. Or a function of auto-sync from dropbox is equivalent too. Thanks and pleased to see this feature in next update version 😊",5,com.orgzly
Simon Jackson,"I have used this for a few years. excellent development and regular improvements. would just like to see custom background colour setting , global or per notebook. Also an option to insert inactive timestamps like [2019-03-30] without having to type them. I use this app daily for notes, agenda, Todo, reminders, shopping list etc.",5,com.orgzly
Mounica Mahankali,Great app for those who use org mode to manage their daily tasks. This app gives the power of portability for those who use org agenda. Please keep it updating. Looking for more improvements! Quick suggestion: please add the feature where it automatically counts the no. of tasks done and shows it in the note title. This feature is present in org mode but not in orgzly Thanks!,5,com.orgzly
A Google user,"Very good app! A cool feature would be if it was possible to easily move a note to another notebook in the property window of the note. Now you can see the notebook it is in, but you can't change it. But hey, it's an awesome app. Keep going!",5,com.orgzly
F S,"Absolutely wonderful app. I can put anything that comes to my mind. It will remind me to do my stuff, help me to track them, save things that i may need some day... And has the extraordinary widget to make it even better, making it easier to see things on the app. Your data will be saved in a plain text file, so if you decide to move on to another app or way of dealing with it in the future, it got you covered. I really dig this app, I'm seriously considering donating. Thanks, developer(s).",5,com.orgzly
Can Nerse,"It's been only a day that I downloaded it, but I can't quit spending time with it. The customization is endless, and it is everything I looked for in a to-do app. Sync with Dropbox works flawlessly. I appreciate that it is free and I hope it stays that way.",5,com.orgzly
Alex Zhang,"I rarely ever leave reviews, but I was very surprised by the functionality of this app. It is extremely customizable, and has all the features of other checklist apps out there.

Leola Site,"I really appreciate your efforts of making this great app free, despite Orgzly is far ahead of many paid outliner, but please attend this underlined issues urgently: 1. Whenever I received a shared note from other apps the paragraphs are removed, the whole sentences are freezed together. 2. Link configuration is complex for novice like me: up till now no headway for successful set-up! This feature is my attraction to this app. Pls make link configuration simple as obtained in UpNote.

Owen Whitlock,"Already loving it. I downloaded this app yesterday, and I'm in love with it. I'm a fan of making lists anyway and have been looking for an app to making it easier and more enjoyable. I've pretty much decided this is how I'm going to keep track of every aspect of my life now! It has so many useful features, some of them are quite complicated, but you can just use the ones you want. And there's a handy guide for when you get stuck. Really impressed with this app. Thank you!",5,com.orgzly
Joel Walker,"It's great to have my org agenda on my phone. While it is not a full featured emacs experience, it is clear the developers have a good understanding and appreciation of org-mode.

Looking forward to clocking in a future release.",5,com.orgzly

What I miss by now: - if one heading has tags, show these also for all sub-headings Thanks in advance!",5,com.orgzly

Anthony S,This app has its potential to be useful one day for more people. Right not for me I've spent a small fortune on ink cartridge and print paper just trying to figure out just how inconsistent this app is. It's amazing to be able to save something on phone and excess it on desktop and work with it. But the cost comes when I had to upgrade from therapist to psychiatrist just to deal with the vanishing files. There is no consistency from desktop to Laptop to Android phones. Beside that would be great,1,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Anthony Douglas,"Very confusing interface. There are like notebooks, quick notes and main notes. These are all mixed up and it's hard to just take notes and know where they are. Secon biggest problem is clumsy syncing attempts. I have to sign in and out to get sync working and when I finally see my notes it says they can't be open because I may not have permission.

Michael Jackson,Very confusing...will not sync all notebooks and pages. Can not cut and paste from notebooks to Google notes or some other apps.

Lionel Johnson,"Given that after a recent update, this app now hangs on the splash screen on my Samsung S8+, it is worthless. Several reviewers have reported the same problem and given the lack of urgency from Microsoft to provide a fix for what is a mission critical app for many, I have to deem Microsoft an unreliable provider and will be switching to a new note taking app.",1,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Devyn Phelps,"When I had a Windows phone and used the Windows Store version of OneNote, I loved it. The interface was phenomenal; the options were minimal and concise; it synced well across my devices; and, it was easy to create different types of documents (.doc, .pdf, .exc) by moving data. Since switching to an Android, I cannot even get OneNote to open. It says there is an error every time I attempt to open it. I have reinstalled, tried different devices, and much more with no luck. What am I doing wrong??",1,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Melrah,"I wish I could use it for longer before it refuses to upload images or sync then crash. I keep having to uninstall it, not impressed! Says I'm not connected to the internet or my account doesn't have access, forcing me to sign out with the hope that this will be the time it will let me sign back in again. It is very difficult to hold and drag a text box with your fingers for devices without a mouse. I would like the option to add sections within sections as well, for extra organization.",1,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Kate Danis,"I downloaded one note because i can sync all my notes accross my computer, phone, and tablet. This application works fine on a computer, but the mobile app does not have an undo feature.

Michael Persaud,"Best note taking app, hands down. Syncs with all other devices instantly. I especially appreciate the hand drawn or write feature (amongst many others of course).

It was a savior while in college and I I use it both personally and professionally for everything from planning my son's nursery to taking tracking progress on work projects.

Katie Ramos,"That is IT! I've had it with OneNote for Android. I'm a OneNote devotee of old, having adopted it on Windows fairly early. I was disappointed with the limited number of features it supports on Android, particularly since I do more than half my work on mobile devices, but because I like the Windows version so much and get all its features with my Office account, I kept it. But about six months ago now, I started getting an error reading, ""Please set up notebooks to share to OneNote"" after sharing from any app but Chrome. But my notebooks WERE set up. Once I shared from such an app, I couldn't share from anything, including Chrome, until I uninstalled and reinstalled. I tested it after various OneNote updates and after Android updates to no avail. Speaking with support multiple times yielded no results. Today my phone finally upgraded to Pie, so I gave it another shot. Still no luck. Frankly, I'm tired of copying and pasting URLs from apps, pasting them in Chrome, and sharing them to OneNote from there. On top of that, I get syncing errors constantly. Far too often I get the ""There are conflicting changes on this page"" message, and it results only from using the mobile app, never from Windows. I am absolutely fed up with both these errors and how despite many updates the app STILL is very limited in features. So I'm going to suck up having less storage space and no offline support for mobile (I'm rarely offline anyway) and switch to Evernote. I'm disappointed, but what can you do when Microsoft drags their feet on fixing and improving the app in the slightest.",1,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Doctor Nofuxgiven,"I enjoy the ability to freely layout tables, text and images to organize a story I'm working on in the desktop version. This software, however, is completely Non-functional on mobile. It is never synchronized to my latest edits which makes Onenote essentially useless. The desktop version has its issues as well. Importing an image, for example, will shift entire bodies of text and then I have to drag and scroll in the most ghetto of fashions to remake my formatting. There are much better tools...",1,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Chris K,"Please fix this: the side pane (view of the various pages of a section, and the various sections of a notebook) DISAPPEARS every time you touch your note, even to scroll down.

Kris R.,"The Android app has never worked well and appears to be abandoned, too. It doesn't see any of my notebooks on OneDrive for unknown reasons. Reinstalling fixes nothing.

Eric Cox,"If you are used to the desktop version, or even the cloud version, you will find this app painfully lacking to the point of being useless. Somewhere along the line the team at Microsoft in charge of software to app migration must have simply forgot this app or just didn't care enough to finish the job. I suppose if you are just tapping line after line of simple notes this app may work for you, but everything else is clunky, non-existent, or just doesn't work like it does in the other versions.",1,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Roger R.,"I tried jumping to this from Evernote and it's just not as well built for long acts of writing/typing on a smartphone. It is full of glitches that make simple things like moving the cursor an annoyance like no other, it just doesn't want to go where I want it to go and find myself having to tap multiple times to get it where I want it. Plus, there is this crazy glitch that probably has to do with the Samsung keyboard that just inserts random and crazy words that make no sense whatsoever.",1,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Emmett,"Too Inconsistent I really wish this would work. I try saving web pages that I'm researching, but nothing saves. Then sometimes (rarely) I'll find it does work. It's frustrating.

It wiped out a large chunk of text. THERE IS NO UNDO. Why didn't I use a notepage instead? I was in a hurry to dictate and not able to navigate through sections, etc. It really doesn't matter why.

Patrick Flint,"The windows 10 version of this app is fantastic and has a lot of useful customizability. This version has none of it and I have no idea why they would not at least allow you to make the experience and setup identical across devices. I have been using onenote windows 10 for years while in college and it has always worked so well but this app simply does not compare. Let us add pens, change the order of pens and erasers, move the undo and redo buttons, as well as give us the option to make space (divides the page and lets you drag down to make more space or up to reduce the space) like in the windows 10 version",1,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Ming Liu,"Good concept, but it has issues syncing among devices. I updated the notebooks in PC, synced all.

Hayley Warner,"After a month or two of unsuccessfully trying to sync my notes from my phone so I can access them on my laptop, I have now lost all my notes because for some reason this app could not sync any of my notes even when it was the same account logged in on both devices. This app is horrible at syncing and has not saved any of my notes and instead deleted them all and reset everything. I would not trust this app in keeping important information.",1,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Rebecca Brannon,"OneNote is saying that it has pasted from my copy buffer. It doesn't say where it pasted it. What if we don't want things to be pasted from our copy buffer? Onenote continues to have a buggy editor, which is especially bad for notes that are lengthy. Even if a note has not been edited on any other platform, it is often suddenly declared in conflict. The developers need to eat their own dog food by using OneNote for their own personal notes so that they will see just how horrible it is.",1,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Skum Clothing,"Autosave is faulty. It constantly says it can't sync unless u go on the website or use a computer; not auto saving your full progress all the time.

U can't delete multiple notes at 1 time.",1,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Chef Dawg,This is absolute garbage. Trust me I'm trying to maintain my temper as I'm writing this but over and over and over again the same problems persist. And to follow that up there's zero customer support. This program is developed by the biggest tech giant in the world and they can't write a program that is functional consistently. Constant issues with having to re-enter passwords that never work and always have to be reset and shared with the multiple people that are sharing this platform. I'm done,1,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Britt,"All phone notes disappeared. I went to synch my notebook to have my notes go to my computer but all the notes I'd taken disappeared from all devices.

Joshua Joseph,"Really buggy, moving back to Evernote. -App constantly scrolls to the bottom of the open note when I tap almost anywhere on my screen. Beyond frustrating. I have to manually scroll up every 10 seconds just to write a simple note. -Ability to organize is severely lacking (which is a huge issue for me). Can't sort notes or notebooks by when they were last opened, alphabetically, etc. -Frequent syncing issues. Overall, an experience rife with bugs and which greatly hinders my productivity.",1,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Cam,"Syncing issues, constant crashes, and lost data. some days I can't even get the keyboard to work properly. Some days the keyboard doesn't appear at all. once you're in the ecosystem, there's almost no way to get your notes out unless you hunt and peck, copy and pasting potentially thousands of notes. It's honestly one of the worst programs I've ever used and I'm so bummed to be stuck in it until I figure a way to get my notes out of there. Been trying to escape for years and I have no idea how",1,com.microsoft.office.onenote
David Garner,"I'm dropping this down to 1 star, because it can not be trusted. I lost some important sticky notes, because it glitched out on me, and sticky notes are not saved to the cloud. In the Notebook section, it constantly reformats/changes the margin size of the note, with no clear way of fixing. One time, I accidentally changed the size of the note, but was unable to reproduce the event. The app is not the same as the P.C. version. There are no instructions to be found anywhere.",1,com.microsoft.office.onenote

I've been using it for about 2 years i believe and i haven't changed my mind. Content will disappear before my eyes while I'm trying to edit, and it tells me there are ""conflicting changes"" and i need to open OneNote online to fix it. I don't have OneNote online, I'm just trying to use it on my phone.",1,com.microsoft.office.onenote

Brent Franklin,"This was my most valued app on both mobile and PC for years, but the mobile version has been extremely unreliable for the past few years, to the point I barely ever use it at all anymore.

Just now I went to open a note I typed in last night and only the first half of the note got saved.",1,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Sarah,"What a joke. I expected Microsoft to put as much effort into the Android app as they did for Windows; however, spoiler alert! It's like they didn't even try. This app is exceptionally buggy, laggy, and lacks core features. Some examples: it lacks the ability to perform keyboard shortcuts. The app frequently refuses switch from draw back to type. When typing, the text cursor will randomly move to a different line. When using the select tool, the pen recognition is about an inch off. Do better!",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Nolan Worthley,"Used to be smooth, fast, and incredibly useful. It's now a headache. Finger (cursor) detection is extremely bad - trying to click on a line of text after entering is infuriating!

Cloth3001,"Microsoft OneNote was working fine, until all of a sudden, BAM! Apparently my Microsoft account was locked somehow, probably due to this app. Once I unblocked my account, the app said I no longer had access to my notes, and was not allowed to add anything else either.

Also didn't meet my expectations.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
bryan,"Organized greatly, but with some flaws. I love the way everything is organized on here. Some complaints I have though is if you use it with a keyboard, common hotkeys like ctrl+b for bolding text, and ctrl+u for underlining text, don't work like it would on a computer. It is possible to do it on android as my Microsoft Word/Office app can do it. It would be nice to see that be implemented here though. It would also be nice to have some sort of blackout/AMOLED dark mode as an option.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Geoff Sweet,"Generally speaking, it's not a bad tool to use. Where it absolutely falls down is that it has almost no configuration for the UI.

Andrew Wang,"Organization is great, everything is intuitive, there is no replacement in terms of ease of use, BUT the pen optimization is so damn bad... Very often the pen simply doesn't register until the fifth stroke on my xiaomi tablet 5 and using it for tapping to select navigation bar is just hopeless, and that is not a problem on other apps like my drawing app Clip Studio. The pen feels sluggish and very unresponsive and I'm very sure it's the software. Why is it like this? Please update!",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Person Adam,"Lost its edge. One Note used to have a title/header section with a divider line and date below. Under that was the obvious body of text. Image insertion was easy and straightforward.

There are 3 major limitations to this app: I, the android version does not support handwriting to text, which is annoying. 2, and more importantly, the app does not support doc insertion.

I will just pick another Note app. Very disappointed, Marianne ☹️",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Mathias Dybvik,"This used to be pretty good until they changed it to no longer make OneNote notes by default. That's right, the OneNote app does not make notes by OneNote by default, instead it makes some ridiculous sticky notes that doesn't sync with OneNote. I'm not making this up....

Update: It doesn't help when developers are responding without reading what I wrote. 🙄",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Main Alias,"Buggy and bereft of basic features. I was editing a doc on OneNote Android, and half an hour later it said ""Page conflicts detected"" and told me to open OneNote on PC.

David W,"Would be 5 stars if it weren't for major problems which haven't been fixed since the 2 years I've been using it: the search function is useless on mobile. Instead of being able to scroll through search results, it will highlight instances within a page so you will have to scroll through the page looking for highlights until you find the right one. If you have long pages like me this is a TERRIBLE user experience that makes it frustrating to find notes. Other problems are syncing errors.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Donald Smith,"There's been a incredibly obvious UI layout bug for awhile now on tablet form factors that MS continues to ignore. This, plus the continuing lack of feature parity on Android, even with the existence of Surface Duo (2!), has me rethinking my recently renewed Microsoft loyalty.

Kolby Adams,"My experience is mostly poor. The app FREQUENTLY has many strange bugs like the pen not being calibrated so when you write the actual pen marks show up on the other side of the screen.

I'm giving 2 stars because it seems to function ok for creating notes, but the sync feature is going to be pretty fundamental for most users I think. If I manage to get it working sometime in the future, I will update this review, but for now it's basically unusable on my phone. My device is a Pixel 2, running Android 8.1.0. Carrier is Google Fi.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Steven R. Olsen,"Good, but FAR from great. It says that users can ""Easily organize"". Pertaining to Android mobile devices, this simply is not true.

Tools available for all but the most basic functions do not exist.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Beth B,"I love the PC version of this app, it is extremely useful. 2 stars because when I use it on my phone it crashes a lot, it doesn't load the notebooks, or any sections or pages. When I start a new page, because it won't load my old page, then it crashes before it loads. I can add sticky notes but, more often then not, it doesn't load or save.

Evelyn Guo,"It's a great app for sure but there a re few things that really tick me off. The major one is the unbelieveable lag. I'm a bio student so you can image the amount of drawing I need but everytime I go to the draw feature it is always at least a second behind my stylus. Not only that but when you want to quickly go from drawing to note taking, you can to stop the drawing then exit out of the tab and click ""home"" or ""view"" in order to start typing. It's a little too slow for my taste.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Cody-John Apana,"Crappy experience. Syncing takes forever and, when it doesn't work, a pain in the ass to get working again. I expect better from Microsoft...maybe that's expecting too much though.

Hannah Dickens,"I love using OneNote on my computer (which is a 2 in 1 so I often draw on the screen like a tablet). However, I recently bought an android tablet and the android version of the app is extremely disappointing.

One would think Microsoft would at least be consistent between iPad and other tablets. The one good thing: it syncs between my computer and tablet easily.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
B,Very disappointing. Watered down version of the iPhone version is an understatement. Can't even select more than one note or section at a time to copy/move/delete.

xReamed,"OneNote is a great service, but feels like feedback falls on deaf ears. The Android app is a miserable experience. It hasn't had a meaningful update in years.

I'd suggest finding another app for notes if you use Android a lot.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
DaeHyun Song,"For the most part, everything is great. However, copying and pasting is a nuisance. It's not that you can't, it's that when you do it causes a spacing error or something that causes the text to space out when it shouldn't. This is also concerning text copied from the app itself. I would've thought this would have been fixed by now, but even now it is ruining my documents! Please fix it. I've waiting long enough.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Amber Midyette,"This was an awesome app. However, now as someone else put it, it glitches. I tap on the screen to show the cursor on the new note but it doesn't bring up my keyboard. I use talk to text on the keyboard during client meetings to quickly take notes of the client specifics. Now, in the middle of a meeting I can't write anything down in this notepad and have to go find pen and paper. This can make me come off as ill prepared and wastes their time and mine.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Anthony Faraco-Hadlock,"I love OneNote in general but this mobile app has several issues. It is slow to load. It poorly communicates its syncing state which then leads to conflict pages which you can't resolve on mobile. I can't get the ""add page to home screen"" to work with Microsoft Launcher ironically.

It is such a shame that Microsoft is killing the OneNote 2016 app on desktop Windows in favor of this style of UI.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Dan The Driver,"App is different depending on what device you're using which makes syncing very difficult. Also there is no format, its like an empty chalkboard and when you put different sized notes on the same page it becomes a huge mess that is impossible to organize.

Pavan Nyama,"I lvoe Onenote, and use it across multiple devices. But the Android version gets a very score from me because of the lack of proper stylus support on Chrome devices running android.

Analau Otazo,"Two stars bc it's good. Yeah. But it could be great. I'm assuming the unfixed bugs (like having pass protected pages lock you out every 2 min) are due to its lack of popularity. Hopefully they'll be addressed, so that I won't have to drop the app all together. _The sync to desktop is really useful and the organization of tabs it's great.

I constantly have issues where notebooks do not update for days at a time, even when it claims to have synced on both my phone and computer. Sign in issues are a constant problem as well, where it will reject passwords I know are correct and then accept them 20 minutes later.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Victor Le,"The app itself is good, but it is no-where close to the desktop version. That version is more feature-packed, more customizable, and just overall a better experience than this app. Microsoft, if you see this review, please update this app. I really would like to use OneNote as my primary way of taking college notes. Also, please stop showing the ""recent pages"" page when I start the all. I prefer going directly to my most recent notebook compared to the actual recents page.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Stephen Kamucheka,"Great note taking app. 2 star because it lacks so many important features that the desktop version has e.g. ability to resize pages, choice of different types of erasers (being stuck with only a stroke eraser sucks if you do a lot of drawing where you always want to do micro-deletions of pen strokes). This app could be so much better than what it currently is.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Thomas Mooney,"The app is great on all other platforms, but is missing several key features on Android, and has been for years. This is such a disappointment. Just having the insert space feature for me would be a huge improvement, but Android is seem as a second class citizen to Microsoft apparently. Even though they make an Android phone, and Android app support seems to be a big deal for them with Windows 11. Actions speak louder than words. Improve your Android experiences.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Aline Moreau,The options are really limiting when you compare to the windows app. There are so few brush options. I can't change the size of the grid-lines. I miss the insert space tool the most :/ I've also been having a buggy experience where the pen doesn't match where I put the S pen on the screen or the lasso tool suddenly doesn't work and I have to restart the app to fix it. I'm going to switch to Samsung Notes for now.,2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Tim,"Microsoft OneNote would be a great app, seems tobe an adequate replacement for Samsung Notes & would've received a better rating if it didn't continue to keep freezing upon the opening of the app & having to make a note to make a note at a later time when the app decides to open. A few pros about this app when it does work properly is it dosen't have annoying ads like some of the other apps, it's free, has color ink, highlights, also being able to copy & paste txts & pics to notes.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Emily Fischer,"I am very disappointed that this app does not have a right to text feature on the Galaxy tab S7. I just bought this new tablet to use to take notes for school, and to not be able to convert my handwriting to text is very frustrating. I usually like Microsoft products because everything is integrated across all of my devices. Please fix this!",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Amy Nguyen,"It's the only free decent note app for class notes in the play store and it is REALLY annoying. When you lift your pen off the screen, all strokes shift up a millimeter for no reason. You have to write slightly lower to accomodate for the shift. The app occasionally syncs improperly and deletes random pen strokes all over so that super important class notes I took for the day are rendered UNREADABLE. The latest update bugged the eraser so I have to refresh the app for it to erase.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Elizabeth Hackl,"Would work well if it didn't constantly change or delete words whenever I am typing or attempting to make corrections. It will also randomly move my cursor to a different location in the midst of typing. Sometimes in the middle of other words, where it then deletes and changes. This has always been an issue and only seems to be getting worse. I will be looking for an alternative app.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Emily Hutker,"This app is great, and I want to love it, but it will NOT stay open while dealing with a webpage. The moment I click away from the OneNote app, it immediately crashes and it makes it nearly impossible for me to take notes properly. Someone PLEASE FIX THIS. The app is wonderful other than the crashing issues.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
J Jackson,"I like the app on my PC but I can't pull up my notes in mobile app. Kind of defeated the purpose of switching from another app that works great. In addition, I can't include screen shots or pics into my notes, as I can with the other app I've been using for years. This app is more frustrating than it's worth. Looking for improvements soon.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
DON JONES,"Rating lowered and revised. OneNote for Android is missing a number of features that are in Windows 10 and online versions. 1. If click the mic. icon it will just record a audio file and drop it in a page. No dictation. Google Keep will convert it to text and include the audio. 2. When creating a new notebook, you can change folder. 3: Can't create page groups, no multi select - if you want to copy/move pages, it's one at a time.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Gaby S,"For the most part this app is great for notes and taking to my computer. However, lately I've been having huge problems with the spen. If I write too high on the page it will automatically scroll up and mess me up. Sometimes I start writing or erasing and my pen cursor is up the page by 5 lines. There's also a spot on my screen where the cursor doesn't follow my pen and will shift up/down by a few pixels and my writing gets thinner. This is really annoying and I'm surprised it hasn't been fixed.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Jeff Perry,"For YEARS now, I'ved always loved how every other time I use this app it will decide to drop my cursor in the middle of the paragraph and barf out some random text I typed earlier and then continue doing so when I try to move the cursor to fix it until I end up with one giant franken-paragraph that I can't fix. Thank you, Microsoft. At least the desktop version works.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Kevin Smith,Non-functional compared to the desktop version. I use the desktop/online version for so much and it integrates with other MS programs so well. The app version is nothing but an over fancy notepad that seems to mess up the data imported to it. None of the organization tools are included and it doesn't allow for a simple work flow at all. At least let use the web based one instead.,2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Shadow Wolf,"The Android version of OneNote is inferior to that of Apple devices or Windows 10. The interface is limited, you can only choose a few pens, and it really just feels like opening the web version. It baffles me that it can be so far behind the others, which is a pain for when I want to use my tablet to write notes that sync to other devices. Microsoft, don't leave Android users in the dust.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Heidi Hamilton,"I gave it 2 stars because it's been wonderful & dependable for years & years, but like others, in the past few weeks all the sudden it's just hanging on the startup screen! I access these notes daily, sometimes multiple times daily! I am looking for a replacement 🙁",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Darryl Payne,The one feature that has to change is the revert or back arrow button while taking a note. I was in a meeting for about and hour taking a lot of notes and at end hit that button to delete last word and it deleted the entire note. On any office product on desktop that button deletes last word or is undo. I lost the entire note. Every note made ends up having the warning about conflicting changes. Why does this need to happen and why would i need a computer to fix it Ms?,2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
JB Monte,"The app description is misleading for the phone, because almost all features are NOT available. I'm assuming they are meant for the tablet version. For the phone, it's rea lly only good for viewing your existing notes from other devices, or maybe writing very basic notes. The default note app on my phone has more features than this app.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Ashley Huffman,"I really want this app to be better. I love Onenote on my pc, it is super disappointing when I need to use it on my smartphone. Although it does do the basic stuff there are other note taking apps the do MUCH better that don't have the funds a big Corp has. To be honest just letting me have the option to choose where the app opens up would be a great improvement. I hate seeing a list of recent notes when I open the app, give us a choice..",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Brett McMullin,"Needs more features! The lack of features and minor glitches is pretty disappointing for such a staple note taking app. I want to continue to use OneNote due to it working seamlessly with WIN10, but man are the quality features really lacking for this app. I'm using the Note10+ and can truly see the future of this app. Fixing writing issues, adding more colors, adding a similar utilities bar as the one on the computer app are all just examples of things that need to be added to this app.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Timothy Rittof,"I have OneNote on multiple PCs and tablets. I live with it daily. But on one tablet it continues to refuse to upload web pages. It just tells me ""working on it"" until I reboot the tablet, and lose the capture. And the capture is the only reason to have the tablet (Android) version because the display interface is ... less than ideal",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Apple Jackson,"Very difficult to use. The Desktop client is robust and relatively intuitive (though not without it's own issues), but this is a mess. Is there no way to resize the font, for instance? Seems like it would be insane not to have such a feature in a note taking app, but I can't find it. Basically, all I can do is jot stuff down with my s-pen and hope I remember to edit those notations when I can access my desktop.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Chris Andrews,"Auto completing text with a capital letter or apostrophe moves the cursor to the middle of the word and results in jumbled text. Also can't add new pages to the top of a section, which is possible on most other platforms.

31 Witches,"If Notes could add some specific functions that would allow users the ability to search and create groups for display that would make it ideal. The ability to create Notebooks, that can then be broken down into ""sections"" and then again into pages is great for when every detail counts.

Marie B,"Honestly, I've had issues with OneNote on both my phone (S9 edge) and laptop (Surface Go). Both versions have so many glitches, making note-taking a laborious and frustrating process. I had given up using it for lectures when my university was in session; now trying to use it for online lectures and textbooks, I've been pushed to handwrite a decent portion, even as a slow writer. I've been using this for years as I generally use One Drive, but may turn to Evernote for my official notes too now.",2,com.microsoft.office.onenote

On top of that, I am unable to do something as simple as COLLAPSE/EXPAND said section groups.

Dan Barns,"This app is irreplaceable as a means to organize information. The desktop version is more more robust and refined, the mobile much simpler and buggy. For example, creating and modifying tables will not be possible in mobile. It is also full of bugs in what would otherwise be very useful features. Two persistent and frustrating ones are using the microphone to transcribe voice to text, and taking photos to insert into a page. Both fail more often than not.",3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Christopher Cox,"Best note app I have found for organizing a ton of notes. The functionality for changing the order of my notes would be nice to be also be able to change the order of notebooks and sections. Also, the Android doesn't have the sub-page functionality like on the computer and iOS app. Worst, everytime I minimize the app and reopen (like when I am trying to copy/paste from a website into a note), the app freezes for awhile (~15-20 seconds); this is only a recent problem.",3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Bob Chipman,This app. is very useful for doing inspections. The insert options are great. Taking a picture with the ability to draw and make notes on it makes it easy to pinpoint issues. The voice control is quarky and I would like to see a more useable share option like that of drop box. One Note is a great app and is a good tool I use to be more efficient at my job.,3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Deyon Jones,"I love what One Note can do, but it's glitchy. Sometimes I can't access the data from my pages when I really need it, from that aspect it's unreliable not knowing if i have a presentation and can't pull up my digital notes when i really need them. But for the most part, it's a great product that is accessible across many of my devices.",3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
RobShootPhotos,Overall this is a great note taking app. It would be nice if Microsoft To-Do would sync with it or make OneNote more robust with To-Do list. My biggest issue is it is a bit too dependent on the cloud. I don't mind it being cloud based on Android devices but it does not keep a hard copy on my desktop hard drive. I can see it on my hard drive in Onedrive but it is simply a file that is a link to the cloud based file.,3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Snotpicking Potsticker,"Has serviced me for years. Lately I've been getting this annoying bug where the cursor will jump to the beginning of a paragraph instead of where I placed it, and will delete words-- similar happens on desktop too, so frustrating! Sync errors are common if my wifi is not flawless. Placing the cursor without moving the page around is difficult-- also annoying. Tolerable for planning projects; not for quick note-taking. Finally, as a dark theme person, the aesthetic is 2white4me. 🤷",3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
A Google user,"It works better with a Windows phone. Most of the time after writting words (like making a list) if I don't add a period then the next line will repeat exactly what was written before. There seems to always be a conflict between this app and the one online even when I try to sync them. Lots of work arounds for the problems I have but useful. Edit: Took a star off my review since my words keep erasing. After adding to a note and closing out for some time, I find that new words are gone.",3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Ethan Farrell,"Works great on my computer and phone. App can keep notes for everything, and is super easy to organize. However, it keeps restarting my chromebook (Samsung Chromebook Pro) after about 1 minute of use, making it impossible. Also, I can't use the web version because it wants me to use the app. This is a terrible flaw (it used to work) and is the only thig standing between a 3 and a 5 star review.",3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Mike Zuccolo,Very buggy. Often times deleting words results in the last few letters of the word you're trying to delete get copy and pasted infinitely as you're deleting them. Also syncing between devices is sketchy. I lost the first paragraph to a note I typed up on my tablet when I pulled it up on my phone. I had to log into my computer to attempt a recovery. I got this app because Evernote on desktop isn't that great. But I'd say it's better than dealing with OneNote's mobile app.,3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Myron Stewart,"Could be a lot better I use OneNote on my iPad and use to use it when I had an iPhone and the Android version is not as good. When you do a search, the bottom controls keep popping up as you try to search or get stuck so you can't go back to your notes. You have to close app down and reopen it. When you share to it from another app, it never remembers the last location in your notes you saved your note. Please fix this Microsoft.",3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Khalil Hasham,"OneNote is a great tool but I've had issues across various Android updates. In particular, simple integrations don't work as intended with the normal way of using Android. Hitting the space bar twice after typing a period doesnt add an extra space. Worse, when I choose an auto correct option in my keyboard the cursor moves to the front of that word instead of after it which impacts the flow of typing.",3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Nick Lepore,"I like using this app for my classes and note taking. There are just a few areas that give me headaches when using it. I am an engineering student and I would like to copy sections of writing and paste them somewhere else (i.e. long equations, graphs, diagrams...). This is a feature that it is supposed to have but does not work. I am using the Samsung tab s3, maybe it's my platform? But still, it should work on all devices. The tab S3 is pretty recent, and am disappointed that such a simple task is hindered in this app. Another discretion, is copying sections into other notebooks or copying pages into other notebooks. This should be a function that is able to work seamlessly with all devices. Unfortunately when trying to organize my notebooks and sections, I had to do some searching to find out that i cannot perform that function on my tab s3. The. I tried going online, since it syncs with the cloud... couldn't do it there either. Eventually I found that if I downloaded onenote onto my laptop, I was free to move around whatever I wanted. Please fix this, spent hours trying to do this for an assignment. Overall, the app is great. Just please fix the weird little quirks that make using it kind of a headache, at least when handwriting notes. I got this tablet and note taker in hope to make not taking more efficient, so far it's almost just as bad as writing with a pen and paper.",3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
GlassFiend,"Solid for looking at notes, but writing them is a bit lacking. There are very limited options to formatting your information. There's bold and bullets but there are zero font options such as larger fonts for titles. Works great for quick notes but a pain, imo, for collecting and organizing your ideas on the go. The lack of dark mode hurts the convenient experience when paired with OneNote(cp), as one has it and the other doesnt. Still this is a really great FREE tool paired with OneNote(cp)👍👍",3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Kiyuki Peery,"I wish you could copy and duplicate notebooks and such if you wish to do so. There is a lot missing, comparing it to my computer, that is. Whatever I can do on my computer, this app should also be able to duplicate. Also, I should be able to access my clipboard so I can paste different things. It makes the app a bit inconvenient compared to the app on my surface pro. I can't take my tablet everywhere I go in order to access the great features you offer. This app lacks in comparison.",3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Andrew Koransky,"Love the app when it works, but synchronization is finicky. My OneNote notebook sometimes syncs just fine, but sometimes it cannot sync with a message ""we couldn't open this section"" and I can find no other details available about the problem. When syncing does work, the updates are often delayed by quite a bit. With a little troubleshooting, I discovered these failures seem to occur with substandard network/wifi connectivity, but I don't have issues with other apps. Microsoft needs to make the sync ability in this app far more robust!",3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Ma Hu,"Functions superbly when it wants to sync and be reliable! Lately, not so much. No notification is given when app malfunctions and stuff doesn't sync/save lest the user happens to go into the exact same spot they were the last time prior to exiting the app. And even then it's only some wonky msg that doesn't even make sense saying one thing & advising user to log in online if it keeps up for further details...whaat??! Please fix if you want to keep users from going elsewhere.",3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
john ater,"Love the concept. The execution sucks. Changed default font to Times New Roman and 1/2 the time it returns to Calibri but shows TNR as the font.

Those bugs get annoying when trying to keep pace with a rigorous academic curriculum.",3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Karis Ulrich,Needs some work as far as features. I have been using Note to write for the past year or so on my computer and it's great for the most part. The app is only okay but it would be a pain to swtich now... Could be better if it had: - Indent capability - Word count - Spell check - A quick way to find new edits by another user (currently the pages don't even bold when there has been a change) - Ability to change notebook colors within the app Would give it five stars with these changes!!,3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Dennis Hammond,"I've been testing several note management apps and kept coming back to onenote for its wealth of features (2016) desktop version and the integration with this app. Fantastic way to keep track of ideas and anything important. Where I have issues is that there is currently a bug in the android that prevents you from sharing info from another app like Chrome. So, if you try to save a web page to onenote the share window appears but it times out. If they fix this then it's 5 stars.",3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Kristen Dussault,"I love using One Note, but I am frustrated. I see that on Ipad and on the desktop app that you can add unlimited pens and highlighters. I wish I had that option on my tablet.

It feels lazy from the development end.,3,com.microsoft.office.onenote

Michael Staschke,Really wish it was just like on windows. I love how on windows you can format the text in a box. I can't find a way to adjust the size of the text or what ratio the text is put out in. I want to just be able to type a paper and print it straight from my phone but I can't because it won't let me format it. But I love how seamlessly is syncs between my computer and phone. Even if it comes out weird on my phone for no apparent reason.,3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Gary AP,All in all very useful to collect notes from any device. But...I frequrntly have symc issues that requires signing out of mobile app and logging back in. The in app error message states that i havr to resolve onlinr or on a computer but that had never worked for me. Formatting on a page is sometimes akward. If not for the sync issue it would get 4 stars.,3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Sheila Stewart,"I cannot always edit my notes and sometimes the formatting changed while using different devices. Not sure if me but at times I lose where my cursor goes.

Barb van Kerkhove,"I like how you can use OneNote on different devices. However, I am frustrated that it does not sync up easily, even when I go to the online version as instructed.

Tyler Temple,"The One Basic Feature that OneNote Lacks & Desperately Needs: Sort Notes by Date Edited! For the life of me, I dont understand why an otherwise top-notch note taking app would not have this basic organizational feature. It is such a pain to have to thumb through the pages of a notebook section hoping to randomly find the right page, since its unorganized. I LOVE OneNote, but because I cant sort the notes by date edited, its almost unusable in practice. Now actively looking for an alternative app",3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Robert Shermon,"I like when it works, but half the time it gets stuck on launch, making it unusable. Here's a fix for anyone having this problem - open the app, then go to settings -> apps - > onenote. Make sure onenote is still open (just not on the screen), and click force stop. If you choose to reset onenote, it'll be like uninstalling/reinstalling. I haven't tried the other option, but it might work too.",3,com.microsoft.office.onenote

Round Lake Railfan,"I've been using this app for a while now, and I only have one gripe about it, but it's a major gripe. If I mistype a word and don't notice immediately, when I go back to correct it, I hit Backspace or the Spacebar, and instead of correcting an error, it duplicates the word that I'm trying to correct. You need to fix that glitch, because it's really getting annoying.",3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Gary Kirk,"As a note taking app, this one works well. The issues I have are with the ui. It loads directly to recent.

Tommy Luong,"I have been using Onenote over the past two years (on Windows laptop and Tab S4). Compare to the version on Windows, the Android app is limited and restricted. Number one there is no ruler and syncing issues. Number two, you cannot adjust the size of the page grids/lines. Erasing function erase strokes (does not do ""smooth"" erasing). Stylus support is alright, however, I wish there was more pen options and ""functionality."" Overall, app could have been better if it is similar to iPad or Windows.",3,com.microsoft.office.onenote

So, Ill pass on this app unless they fix this issue",3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Tristan,Decent for handwriting my notes on my huawei mediapad m5 lite tablet in college. I'd like to see some more customizability on it like changing the dock/selector position to the left side instead of the top so my hand doesn't accidentally touch it when writing. There's also a problem where after taking my pen off the screen the stroke will move slightly making my writing look a little messy. Would also like better latency but that could also be a problem only on my end. Oh also dark mode please!,3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Charlie Enyart,"I love the way you can organize things but other than that this app sucks. It really doesnt work on phones. It was working fine in the beginning but then it kept saying I want signed in. And everytime it said I waant signed in I would lose most of what I had written.

After I put in another email, the app froze and wont let me use it. Please fix this app",3,com.microsoft.office.onenote

cimannon,infinite page space is my favorite thing about this app! just wish that there were more flexibility and customization options. can't change pen pressure settings and cannot set pen/highligher presets. images can only be added as attachment files (same with some other inserted objects). zoom maximization is also a bit limited.,3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Thorn Reilly,"Good app with a WEIRD bug! As I type, it will auto-replace words with random letters, sometimes smashing together the previous word into a string of garbage text... it only happens to correctly-spelled words, and after I hit space. It makes writing anything incredibly difficult as it will start without warning and garble every other word, even as I try and fix it. I love the desktop app and having all my work on my phone is great - I'd give it 5 stars if not for the bug! Great while it worked.",3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Anguel Roumenov,OneNote is good. But mobile execution is mixed. Lack of writing to text is the big miss. I can tolerate reduced organization and formatting features. The simplicity is kind of nice on a phone. But handwriting features are huge on tablets with pen input and I was told it works on iPad which is heartbreaking. This was the main software I got my Tab S7 for. Now I'm forced to mix in S Notes or immediately update notes when I get to my computer. Huge bottleneck.,3,com.microsoft.office.onenote

Ryan,"OneNote's primary feature is organization but it somehow fails to do this in the most basic ways. There is no way to rearrange or rename your notebooks. It organizes them the way it wants and there's nothing you can do about it. You can organize them on iPhone, PC, or Mac but for apparently no reason it won't allow this very basic feature that's at the core of the app on Android. It also has no dark/night theme so good luck using it at night with the blinding white everything.",3,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Dennis Seybert,"I got the app on my tablet and am disappointed that I am not able to convert written notes to typed like I can with the desktop version.

Nate Vemuri,"So, I have been using OneNote for Android on my Chromebook that has a touchscreen. I download PDFs that I need to write on, and instead of paper, I use the OneNote writing tool. Recently, the app has changed the way it looks and I assumed there had been an update.

The thing here is, it is not damaged.",3,com.microsoft.office.onenote

Nathan Pero,The autocorrect and autofill capabilities need alot of work. Cursor jumps lines of text and tries to overwrite previous words.

Nathan Duval,"Decent App....but.... in my opinion I wish Microsoft would take a look at Samsung Notes, look at how they organize folders and pages of information.

S. Vaitheeswaran,"OneNote is the best note taking app, and I have tried several. I haven't explored the mobile version exhaustively on my Samsung Galaxy A50, but it is highly capable and full-featured like the desktop version. The latter is close to perfect. I love the ability to have different notebooks and multiple lists on the same page. Also sub lists and sub-sub lists. Too many other features to mention here. On a small phone screen, you can easily zoom into one part of the page. The one shortcoming is the erratic syncing between my Macbook and android phone. The two were synced well yesterday, but this morning I can't get the two talking to each other. This could lead to two (or more) versions of the same document -- a potential nightmare.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Chrisy D,"I really love this app! It's great that I can use it on Android, Apple, and Windows devices. It syncs perfectly!

And three, I can't highlight text without the keyboard popping up which happens on both Android and iOS. Regardless of these little annoyances, it's one of the best note taking apps available.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Sherin Thomas,"I love being able to organize into notebooks and pages. Only annoying thing is, when it opens, it defaults to ""recent pages"" rather than your notebooks, and I don't see an option to change that.

The user should be able to change it to what suits them.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Claire Birmingham,"Overall its a decent place to write notes. But more often then not, when I use this app on mobile I find that many of my pages end up with a ""this page has a conflict"" notification that won't go away. I end up only seeing a tiny portion of the screen from this, and it's a huge inconvienience and annoyance. The recording feature is a little primative, but you cab work with it. On the other hand, there's plenty storage so you can write all you want, and of course you can open on multiple devices",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Luna Raine,"I -mostly- love this app. I like how many different formatting options there are, and its syncing ability.

It was frustrating to figure out how to move pages, especially compared to Evernote, which does it with ease. I wish the widget asked which folder right away and wasn't glitchy.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote

Jeffrey Lazarus,"So far it's been good. I like the sync...what I write on my app or on my lap top appears in both places.

So I have to change it to the font I want. And sometimes it won't let me change the font so I have manipulate it back to the default. I don't know why it does that. Maybe I haven't figured out how to set it..but the fact that it's set on default should keep it there.its a bug that needs to be fixed. Also..there doesn't seen to be any instructions on how to do all the things it says it can do. No tutorials..so I have to waste a lot of time trying to figure out how to use all these features.

Grace Rodriguez,"I love that this app has different notebooks with their own sections. I really needed that.

Online, OneNote has countless more options than the app -- fix that Microsoft and you have a 5 star app.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
John B,"Besides the occasional, page error/sync conflict, this app is my note taking goto. My notes and various writings are saved on all devices, which is very convenient for those like myself.

Anthony Waechter,"I switched to OneNote after Evernote stopped allowing me to sync devices. While OneNote offers free sync through OneDrive and works well, there are times when the keyboard simply does not open in the app no matter how many times I select a typeable area.

Ashley Smith,"Navigation of the app on a tablet continues to be an issue... I use links to jump between areas more easily, getting prompted no matter how I play with the settings gets a little aggravating, I'd be able to work better without having to jump menus to get to different pages, and keyboard popping up when reviewing notes is a bit hassling.

michael mason,"It's a great Dungeon Master / Storyteller / Game Master organizational tool and while it can be a little prep heavy at first, it makes the games flow much faster and better. My only gripe, comes form using the Android App on Chrome OS is that it saves to the cloud only. If you are offline, it does not save your changes until you are back online. So if your OS takes poop, or you close it before it can sync, it will not save. An offline mode would be pretty nifty.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote

Joe Mc Swiney,Great app for taking notes anywhere on any device and keeping them orgainzed. Docked a point because there is no easy way to dump data for seperate archive and you can't reorganize by dragging notes in the navigation side bar. That could be the version I am on. One Note is not the same program on different devices from a functional perspective. I have tried a few other products and allways came back to One Note.,4,com.microsoft.office.onenote

One note allows me to make list for shopping and look up recipe on one note while I am shopping when I finsh shopping I can store receipt of purchase on one note.

One Note maybe one of most powerful tools you already have. You just need to use it to discover how powerful.,4,com.microsoft.office.onenote

Because that's what I originally want to use this app for, to note down things onto my college courses' slides or books.

A Google user,"I use this app constantly! Being able to work off the same document between my phone and my PC has been great and Microsoft has come a long way in making this process seamless. However the transfer time from putting information on my OneNote app on my phone, to then see it on the computer still has a good deal of lag time even on wifi, and is not always sucessful especially with larger documents. Still a great app!",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Marty Piecyk,"Fantastic app! Here are some suggestions: Allow merge conflicts to be resolved from the app, as opposed to forcing the user to log into a PC Remove the buggy, custom text editing with the purple marker. It randomly doesn't allow the paste dialog on a long press to show up, deletes the wrong text when using the backspace key (randomly), etc.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Bertrand Barbier,"Hi Devs, The app is really good. I started using OneNote recently. I snooped around to see what this app had to offer and also started using the one on my laptop. I loved it! Initially everything worked smooth like butter. Sadly, as of 3 or 4 days ago I noticed I could not sync. It could be a minor bug. WiFi is working great, no issue there. I made sure both devices were even connected on the same WiFi access point. Please check into this as I noticed other reviewers faced a similar issue. -Bert",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Rob Crichlow,"I like this app very much.  It has all of the features required to take professional notes while in mobile only locations.  It syncs very nicely with OneNote across all of the my devices with no issues.  However, I really want to have a summary option for the page list like Samsung Notes has and Windows Phone version had.  Please add this extremely useful feature and I will immediately go to 5 stars.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Karlo Valencia,"Although, not as pratical as its desktop counterpart, you do get a lot with this little app. my favorite thing to do is jot down quick notes of text, or even snap a picture. Then later I will organise it better on the computer. The synchronicity between the apps is highly efficient and it doesn't require you to save--it saves as you are type. I've tried other note apps and I definetly recommend OneNote as microsoft seems to be ahead with there line of productivity apps.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Trinketchi,"A handy and multipurpose utility between computer and smartphone. The inclusion of the undo button and text editing options are wonderful. If not for the text-interfering bugs I'd give it five stars. (Occasionally, typing or moving the cursor will cause the last thing you typed to be repeaded, and the cursor itself may not take your input where placed, cutting preexisting text or jumping to a different location.)",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Jonathan Bishop,"I've used OneNote religiously for years because it's easily the best note taking app available. My only complaint about the Android app is that the password protected sections will lock me out about every 2 minutes, even if I'm actively typing, and then once I've unlocked it it doesn't show the keyboard unless I close the page I'm on, navigate up a level, and then open the page again. Very annoying little quirk.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Don Harder,"I cannot live without this program. I was diehard on Evernote until I discovered OneNote. Not only was it included in the Microsoft 365 subscription we have but it integrated perfectly with my Android phone, Surface tablet and MacBook Pro laptop. Indispensable! My only little thing is the inconsistent clipper on the Android version. I tend to save the links for the desktop which is more consistent. But that's a small thing for the benefits.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Ultranius Maximus,"An almost perfect solution for organizing your information (notebooks, sections, section groups, pages, sub-pages, paragraphs, sub-paragraphs/outlines, etc.). The full desktop version is the best way to go as usual, but the mobile version is excellent for simple tasks on the go, like honey-do lists. Thanks, Microsoft!",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Josh Geyer,"Really useful thing to have on my phone, it works great. What I will say is that on GS9+, the teardrop that you use to scrub through text to get to precise locations is really crappy. The icon itself is all pixelated, and even when I tap on it, it is really hard to actually select it. Besides that, great app!",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Suyaib Ahmed,"amazing i love taking notes on this, just wish it had a little more features: math equation, lines and shapes, page layout. when sharing notes as pdf it's just a single page that is super long and hard to read until you zoom in, so wish it split the notes into pages. Also an outline of a 8 by 11 inch page would be helpful when taking notes.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Ng Racky,Thanks developers for bringing more colour for the highlighters. I would love to see the eraser function being upgrade as well in the next update which is not limited to stroke eraser only and the ink to shape function as well since these functions are not new functions they are available on Windows and iOS version of OneNote. Therefore I think it is not that hard to bring them to android apps.,4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Harrison Johnston,App is wonderful. Trying and writing experience is good. Syncs to PC quickly. The viewing experience is not great. Especially if you have more than 1 collum of text. If they figured out how to adjust zoom and text wrapping to fit on mobile better than this would ALWAYS be my note app. But for that reason I only use it sometimes,4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
hamid abbasi,"Love the app for taking notes on my note 8. Only thing i donot like is that it doesnt recognize hover functions to move up and down a document and more importantly, ONLY ONE HIGHLIGHT COLOR. Why is this a thing. For people who color code we need multiple colors and sadly this really hinders that. Hope they add more colors. Other than these few negatives, a really solid app",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Andrew Scott,"Good app. Great for taking notes, love the sync between platforms and I like the look of the app. A few minor suggestions though. The zooming and planning are finniky. Also I don't like that the text boxes for pages I make on the phone are a different size than the ones I make on the computer, so on the computer the text stops at different spots on different pages. Also please allow us to make section groups on mobile and web.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Nikki Foster,"Overall, I love OneNote because of the ease of using across multiple devices. I use both Android and IOS so I can compare the two. I'm very disappointed that the Apple app version is far more robust than the Android version - this is a fail. The Apple version is very close to the desktop version. Android version doesn't allow for pen or paper customizations nor can you select which notebook you want to ""share"" from a program/site, it only goes to Quick Note. Android should mirror IOS.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
BlairWare,"Nice! Pros: One Note has been tweaked to work better with the S-pen and the Note Series in general and is now a real alternative to S-notes/ Samsung-Notes. It is better integrated, offers an""always-ready"" Quick- note feature, and of course is seemless withthe rest of Office. Cons: Daunting learning curve, mostly around FINDING everything, and Navigating. Most of it works, but it won't make you forget you are working with a computer that you are holding in one hand",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
JD Blatt,"One of the best ways to organize notes and information. It can handle large amounts of media in various and unconventional organizations (like tables filled with pictures collapsible into bullet points) which Scrivener can't do. It lacks some of the text formatting I'd like, but it is still more open ended (and cheaper) than World Anvil or Notebook.ai.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Al Ro,"Overall, it's a pretty great app. Very useful. The only complaint I have is about the mobile version, it's a bit wonky and sensitive to touch or movement of the page. again, decent app. Edit: Recently, it's had problems back spacing once you've created a new paragraph.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Tristan Tjan,"This app is amazing on so many levels, allowing notes, pictures, and entire notebooks to be synced in a few seconds as long as you have internet connections. However I do wish the offline ability was improved as it can be quite finicky if its offline. I am not removing a star for that and instead I would like to see better Samsung Dex Functionality, specifically Ui improvements when OneNote is taking up the full screen or keyboard shortcuts like I have on my pc such as bullet points.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Zane Ross,"Great Note taking App for Android & Cross Platform Supports formatted text, hyperlinks, and multiple media and document formats. Notebook organization is also easy to manage. The only reason that I'm removing a star is because there is a bit of input lag when taking notes with the S Pen on Samsung devices. The lag is not present on other note / drawing apps I use. Fix that issue and maybe add a dark mode, and you will have a five star app!",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Mel Parker,"There have been some updates since my last review. The issues causing my Samsung Chromebook to restart seem to have been resolved. I mostly use OneNote to take notes for school. The ability to access my notes on all of my devices is fantastic. There are some limitations inregards to using the app in tablet mode on my device, but I don't find them to be so obnixous that it stops my usage.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Hue Chau,"Love app and usefulness. However there are some very annoying features such as once active, hover corner of screen which can be easily triggered when you don't want to access it. Wish there was better way to dock app without false trigger as very sensitive no matter location on touchscreen. I've installed on Android phone.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Evan Popchock,"This is an awesome app for saving articles, videos, etc. And for taking notes. I recommend this app for everyone. Update 3/2/2020: I recently started having issues saving articles on my phone with this app. When I try to save any articles directly to the app on my phone, it doesn't give me any indication that it saved anything and after letting it go for 5+hours, it still says ""working on it"" and will not finish whatever it's doing; it just continuously loads without end.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Steven L.,"install, immediately be hit with significant lags to sync and do anything, an endless stream of small bugs (widget not updating, tap one notebook and a different one is displayed, major task stack confusion that can get you an app that can't go back to the main page, this is all just in 5 minutes there were more later)... feature set is pretty good but holy cow is this janky. are the desktop versions this bad? I'm definitely going elsewhere.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Kim Crain,Love this app. I have it on my laptop as well as my phone and my tablet. Unfortunately I am finding that the android version doesn't have as many features. This is the place I use it most due to my S Pen and I'd really like to see more handwriting options such as being able to customize your highlighter. I also wish I could add more pens like in the other versions. Overall a nice app though.,4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
James McMurray,"I'm using the app more and more. In my experience it is unique in that I can add hand written notes and diagrams to imported text. I have had some problems syncing notes on some of my devices. Also, I have not been able to create bookmarks or hyperlinks within notes.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Nick Gapp,"I like it, it still needs refinements to the syncing with one drive. it was not syncing to my computer until I opened it from the online app into the local desktop app. It only occurred when i created a note from scratch on my Samsung Galaxy S8. love the depth of the app though. Could use smoother integration and merging with other apps",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Gaurav Dhital,"Works great until it doesn't. Works great on a 10.1 in. tablet with pen. It's great for the most part but very rarely erases tiny parts of text (the straight line from 1 missing, etc.), so I need to double check everything to make sure nothing's magically disappeared before sending in my assignment.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Ted Gusmer,"Overall has worked really well. I switched from Evernote because of font reformatting issues. Only 2 complaints: 1. Sharing options poor. Only viable ways to share a note is to output to share to Word, then save as PDF to the cloud, then share the file using the cloud share. Yes, a PDF share option from OneNote Android exists BUT it puts it all on one page so a 3 page note, it is so small it's unreadable.Come on Microsoft, paginate! Other is sometimes sync issue. Resolution works but only online",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Bobbie Kightlinger,"Overall, this app is great. There are a few things I get frustrated with, at times when I go back to edit a word it'll begin deleting what's in front of it, also copying large entries is quite frustrating as well, other than that, it works fine.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Adam Gray,"Good for accessing your OneNote notebooks from your phone. The sticky notes feel shoehorned in as an after thought. I wish I could make this the default option when I open the app. When I'm taking ""notes"" with my phone, I am looking for something to type a quick thought or a to add to a liat for the grocery store. This app does not load fast enough, and takes extra steps to get to that function. I'll keep the app but will lost likely rarely use it. I'll go back to Google Keep.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Abraham Romney,"I like onenote, and it's nice to be able to use it on android. Please make it so that audio recordings can easily play across platforms. If I record on my PC, none of my android music apps can even open the sound file. It should be seamless and work the same on both platforms.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Mik,"Like a lot and have used for years but still needs some tweaks. This app allowed me to integrate a d consolidate. I used to use Evernote and some lesser known others but they all had limited formatting, editing and integration [with other apps] features. A long time MS Office user (isn't everybody?) I decided to give OneNote a try. I liked its paper like notebook form factor. Now I use it to capture a d catalogue everything work and personal! My one wish, as with all MS software, is consistency",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Allie Falco,Love it so much except for one bug and it might be a keyboard bug not a OneNote bug for all I know. Freedom in your note hierarchies. You can put any kind of data in a note seemlessly. Syncs really well between your various devices. You can link notes in other notes wiki-style. Custom note templates are easy to set up. Bug: sometimes backspace will instead paste copies of the word or character I'm trying to delete. Wanted: suggest page links when I type a page title.,4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Linda,"I like the concept of notebooks, sections and pages. The app on my phone (Galaxy S7) is cleaner UI because the sections of a notebook are laid out with the entire title shown. On my Galaxy Tab S6, the notebooks, sections and pages are in columns and the titles are truncated. There is no slider to adjust the columns and the pages show the left edge until I slide them over to see the whole page. This app is obviously optimized for phones, but tablets are important too. Please work on tablet UI.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Romesh Prakashpalan,"Not as polished as the iOS and Windows offerings, sadly. But the biggest issue is that keyboard and mouse support is lacking. I am using this on a Surface Duo (a Microsoft product!) and the mouse doesn't always work appropriately and the standard keyboard hot keys and such just do not work (paging around quickly with pagedn and so forth). If these were fixed, it would be a great improvement for using it with the Duo. It is strange because the Office app works well with mouse and keyboard.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Stormy,"It's nice to have the app, but too awkward for long writing, but that's what the desktop is for. I have noticed that my pages don't always sync correctly where pages I deleted would have to be deleted again on the desktop and couple times I've had to fix conflicts. I still use the old 2016 at home as the app doesn't have everything I use yet... but I also still haven't figured out how the app can create thumbnails next to pages. I want to do that so badly like I've seen in demos.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Matthew Patton,There's very few note apps that allow you to add photos/pictures to them. I spent a lot longer looking through notepad apps looking for one that did than I care to admit. OneNote does everything I need it to and is actually an improvement on the notepad app I was trying to replace now that I'm on a new phone.,4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Shasta Walton,"Although there are iterations of OneNote that I like better than the current version, it's an essential program for me. It allows me to keep notes and references regardless of which electronic I'm using. It allows me to store information so I can compile it later. I recently added a Rocketbook to my collection of electronics. Now I can easily put handwritten notes in OneNote. I can use an ocr to convert handwriting to text. I'd be lost w/out OneNote",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Emperor XLII,"OneNote as a whole does a good job tracking notes across all my devices (very occasionally will get an update conflict, if network gives out on the middle of sync, but takes just a moment to correct on a desktop machine); sadly, Android client has a couple of annoying bugs: first tap then edit will often change text on a different line (info, then tap somewhere else and back corrects it), and used to show Microsoft emoji, but now only show question mark boxes (same page on desktop looks right).",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Travis Billiter,"Formatting with bullets can be a bit rough, but invaluable since it links with the OneNote on my PC (it's also an issue with the PC version of OneNote). Have one page that acts really weird and doesn't play nice on mobile. No idea why, but moving text off that page to another which works ok so it shouldn't be a problem any longer.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Alicia N,"This thing is so handy. We started using it at my job, and I ended up downloading it for my personal use/side work. The only thing I would like to have in the app is some table functionality. Occasionally has issues with synching. Overall though I love it and use it for everything from notes to pictures",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Joyson Sebastian,"I find it useful for synching notes between pc and phone. Needs improvement for the app: it goes back to the previous line I was writing in the notebook only for the latest file I was editing. It forgets the last position for all other files. When I have long notes with multiple files, this is very inconvenient to scroll in the phone",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Jesse Perez,"I've always kept important info such as account information, copied material via copy/paste I may find while browsing the net, or even from casual conversations. I'm glad they have an app for mobile, as I really am a fan of the app used for desktop (which has way more format choices to choose from, which is why I rated this specific mobile app a 4/5). This definitely gets the job done when it comes to basic activities.",4,com.microsoft.office.onenote
Tanner Sterling,"Absolutely great and easy to use note taking app for smaller notes or lists. I use it for all my daily ""sticky note"" type of notes and for grocery store lists.

But it's been a real game changer for me in terms of creating content, as being able to insert pics/links, markup pages, etc. has allowed me to build detailed outlines for long-form articles & collect required media assets. The #1 help is prolific content creation, my VAs get notebook containing writing/media, wireframe & example layout marked up by me. 24H later my post is live w/no further input from me 👍👍👍",5,com.microsoft.office.onenote

Now that I'm working on projects and presentations that require different media on PC and android os, I couldn't find an app to accommodate all I needed. So, I went back to one Note, took some time to watch some videos on how to use it, and so far, it's amazing!

I'm using Notes in hopes of having a native note taking application since I made the leap from chrome to safari I didn't want to have any extra downloads, but I hate it.

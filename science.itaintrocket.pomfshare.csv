The Beshear Family,This app does exactly what it is intended for! I absoulutely love it!! The only thing that i did not like is the fact that each link you make only last for 7 days so you would keep having to make a new link every week pretty much but you can still connect it to the same domain which works out from the outward appearance.. But all in all this app is Awesome! Thank you to the developers for making this app! God Bless,5,com.fileupload.filesharing.upfile
Nilushi Dinushani,I was searching for a file uploading app for instant file sharing which is safe and troustworthy. This brilliant UpFile app helps me to solve my problem easily. Keep it up. All the best. Excellent work.,5,com.fileupload.filesharing.upfile
Joshep Starlin,UpFile is brilliant file upload app. It does exactly what I need and does not ask for any permissions except network access. Great to see a developer caring about not using unnecessary permissions! ‚ù§Ô∏èüëèüëè,5,com.fileupload.filesharing.upfile
Zakey Wisdom,"Great app, plz everyone, download this app. If you are searching for a safe internet transfer app, this is it. Exactly what am looking for. You can upload all files of any size and once downloaded, it's deleted from the server. 5 star for you guys.",5,com.fileupload.filesharing.upfile
Nilushi Dinushani,Best upload app that I have seen..‚ù§Ô∏èüòò Tried many apps but they were nothing comparing to this upFile app. I am using it for few months time and it is very supportive and and user frindly.

Tim Wilson,"I'm very unhappy with Dropbox deleting the album feature from the app. They replied that I can access my pics through the photo button, no kidding. The problem was I had several pics out of thousands added to albums for easy access but it was changed without notice. I'm now more unhappy with what appears to be an insensitive auto generated response. Looks like it's time to find an alternative solution.",1,com.dropbox.android
Davina Wells,"After the Android update this month, Dropbox won't open at all. Uninstalling, clearing cache/storage, resetting allowances, nothing works. The furthest I've been able to get is logging in before it starts crashing again. It also brings up a ""market feedback agent"" error when it crashes. This is the only app I've had problems with since the update.",1,com.dropbox.android
Erin Mawhirter,Very difficult!! I signed up for the free trial to see if this would be a good app to send large picture files to family. It has been the opposite of user friendly. Canceling the subscription is way too difficult for a regular person. It says it is sending you to options for cancelling that then don't exist. Just finding out what type of account one has is difficult. I use a lot of apps. I found this one to be frustrating with support fairly unavailable.,1,com.dropbox.android
Justin Time,"After hearing how great Dropbox was I created an account and tried to upload some videos. I got a message saying ‚ÄùCan't upload file. Account full."" Searched ""help"" and nothing came up. Of course there was no ‚Äùcontact us"" page or info in the app either. So with a BRAND NEW account that shows 2GB of space I can't do anything! A one star rating is one too much. MAJOR FAILü§¨‚òπÔ∏èü§Ø",1,com.dropbox.android
Drew,"Not sure what Dropbox is doing but crash crash crash crash crash pixel 6 pro. Don't know why works fine on any other Android phone, but on Google's new pixel crash crash crash reinstall doesn't do anything. It's still just crash. Can't stress it enough then crashing since I got the phone and I've had the phone for several weeks now and other people are complaining about the same thing. Where is the update to fix this? Come on there's no reason for a bug this extreme to last any period of time.",1,com.dropbox.android
Preston Petersen,"Loooove how selecting to save files locally somehow results in files that haven't even slightly changed needing to be re downloaded 20 times a day. Completely defeats the purpose of the app. Absolutely useless. The last time i used it, the only way i could view files that were supposed to be already downloaded was to completely restart my phone. Tons of people reporting fundamental issues with the app... Just make it work!",1,com.dropbox.android
Phil Greiss,"Well well... playing audio thru dropbox became a pita now with the last few updates. Before this show-stoper we could click on an offline wav file in a dropbox folder and have VLC (or your player of choice) start playback *instantly* but now, the cluncky dropbox audio player puts itself beetween you and VLC, making it impossible to quickly audition a series of audio files, adding 3 clicks to a process that used to only take ONE. These constant updates destroy things that do not need re-thinking.",1,com.dropbox.android
BHAKTI BROPHY,"Cannot find ANY of the documents I just ""Uploaded"" from my Android. I also tried ""Sharing"" documents directly from phone to Dropbox app-- which is an option, and only two files transferred. I tried doing them as a group of documents, and transferring one at a time. Still no luck. The only useful thing about this app is receiving documents and videos from other folks. What a shame-- especially since greedy Google decided to take away Google Docs. 'Need trustworthy cloud service.",1,com.dropbox.android
Elyes LOUCIF,"How do I use it if I can't sign in? I can sign in just fine through the browser. However the app doesn't work. With the same password... I can't even reauest an email sign in, or to change the password through the app (by sending an email). Absolutely major flaw.. no cloud storage service could compromise the mobile experience in this way. I have never been a fan of dropbox and this just confirms it. I will be switchint soon.",1,com.dropbox.android
Molly Kitti,"No tech support at all. This used to be a great app, but the most recent security patch broke it. Spent months trying to get help from tech support, but no luck. It's nothing by bots who assume you have a common question and repeat the same wrong answers at you over and over. After 3 months, I still can't get ahold of a human, I still can't access my files, and Dropbox refuses to provide a refund, even though I clearly wasn't getting the service I paid for. I'm switching to their competitors.",1,com.dropbox.android
Doc Ryzoe Sullivan.,"Before this incident, I considered dropbox to be decent. I don't use it much in my day to day life, but I do use it to send work projects to others at my job. But now I come with a warning: DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE DROPBOX APP TO WINDOWS. USE THE WEB BROWSER. Why? Apparently if you ever have to run a system restore Dropbox batch files will error your system restore, and you will HAVE to do a fresh install. I don't use dropbox for system sync, just work files and it has done irreparable damage.",1,com.dropbox.android
Cory Nott,"Great that it syncs photos. It's awful that it won't actually sync unless battery is over 20%, and there is no way to override this. Users have been requesting this for years, but DB rarely changes anything nor have I seen any app improvements. Time to look seriously at Box.",1,com.dropbox.android
Karen Gilbert,I tried to use the backup Dropbox function and it messed up my entire folder system and lost several documents. The chat function was essentially useless and the person was not able to help. I needed my files back immediately because I had a meeting and the email chain was not quick at all. I eventually found out how to fix it after some fiddling but I would NOT recommend using the backup function. It'll mess up your entire filing system.,1,com.dropbox.android
Ernesto Fernandez,"Not recomended. Put pictures in Dropbox and yes the pictures go to another device but when I try to delete them from the first device which is not easy, they are also delete from all devices. Now I have my memory used up in all devices, can't free anything without much time and deleting my good pictures. So Dropbox is asking for money to upgrade. I should have continued with cable connecting devices to make transfers, much simpler and safer.",1,com.dropbox.android
Funkle,"Much buggier on Androids than iPhones. When you are playing a song via Dropbox on Androids, you cannot do anything else on your phone without cancelling the playback. Furthermore, in the last couple of weeks the screen freezes during a playback and you have to unlock your phone in order to quit the playback. As someone who pays for Dropbox, I would really like this app update/fixed, or I may have to move to another cloud storage app.",1,com.dropbox.android
Vendola Lawrence,"There was an update approximately 7 days ago and now I'm getting notifications that Dropbox has a bug. I tried to open the app, and it closes then I get another error message saying that it has a bug. I pay over $100 a yr (in which the price tends to go up every year or so) for this service. I need this to be rectified asap.",1,com.dropbox.android
Sarah Lund,"I'm a paying Plus subscriber and have been using Dropbox for 15+ years. Never had a single issue until today; after updating my Pixel 3A to Android 12, the app crashes when I try to log in. Uninstalling the app, restarting my phone, then reinstalling the app doesn't fix it. This makes Dropbox completely useless on the single device I use/need it for the most. If this isn't fixed quickly I'll be exploring other options for my storage needs.",1,com.dropbox.android
Georgette Patterson,"Wow! I was so close to downloading and trusting my work and personal photos to this app. So many people who have paid for the app can't access their photos, music, videos and all kinds of chaos even opening the app as of recent? Yeah, sorry for all the reviewers-grateful, but feel terribly bad for them as well. I wish you a proper app that works as it says, as well as a good day. Good luck and Thank you.",1,com.dropbox.android
Brandon Miller,"A miserable experience. Joined when the app was free. Used it for long-term photo storage. At some point, they must have decided to shrink the storage amount offered by the trial. My account is now missing the vast majority of the photos in it before, with apparently no way to recover them. Too many other good storage options to even consider this one. What an utter disaster...",1,com.dropbox.android
Kathy Valenzano,"I had the dropbox basic app. It's suited my needs perfectly, all I use it for is to transfer items from my tablet to PC. However, there was a problem, so I uninstalled and reinstalled it. Something went wrong, because it installed the Dropbox Plus. It is absolutely not what I wanted. It caused all kinds of problems on my system. I've worked with somebody and we seem to have cleared up the problem. However I cannot find the free Dropbox app to reload onto my tablet. What am I doing wrong?",1,com.dropbox.android
Julie Watson,"Over the years, GREAT! With the latest update, TERRIBLE. I've used Dropbox for 10 years. I've never had a problem. It would sync with my mobile devices and my laptops and my desktop computers. The update on June 3 screwed up my mobile app & I am unable to access my files. The error message is ""Can't connect to Dropbox. Make sure you're online, or try again later."" WHAT??!!! Um, my phone is connected via cell service & wifi. Customer Service was NOT HELPFUL. I am very frustrated.",1,com.dropbox.android
matthew obrien,"Dropbox worked great for many years (5 star worthy), but over the past few weeks the app keeps telling me ""cannot connect to dropbox, make sure you are online and try again later"". I am online and my device can connect to any other app just not dropbox. All docs, files, photos are hidden from view. I can only find the desired file if I search for the specific file. I cannot save files to specific folders nor can I move files from one folder to another. It is now very difficult to use the app.",1,com.dropbox.android
Justin Gunter,"I'm really disappointed in this company. I've been a Dropbox user since the very beginning. Suddenly, they've introduced an arbitrary three device limit that makes this all but useless unless you pay $120+ a year. I have no problem paying for valuable services, but the fact that you they want longstanding customers to pay over $120 just to sync four devices instead of three is absurd. This is the writing on the wall, time to jump ship because going forward, Dropbox is going to be looking for every arbitrary way it can to extort money out of longtime users. What's next, caps on how many times you can access a file unless you pay for a new $300 a year ""Elite"" tier of service?",1,com.dropbox.android
Ian Blackwell Rogers,"Really didn't help me. I was sent a link by email to add a file to a Dropbox, and couldn't see any way to do it. I added the app, hoping that would help, but got a notification that was too many devices and I'd have to subscribe. Working with Dropbox on my desktop didn't give me any more success, even when I enabled ""Dropbox for Gmail,"" so I have no incentive to pay for this app. Maybe it only works if you're a paying subscriber. I find this very opaque on any device.",1,com.dropbox.android
Matt Voegtli,"I've been using drop box for around 8 years. I've never had an issue with it. Now it's constantly crashing, disconnecting or just not loading. Hopefully they fix it, because this is crazy. Just roll back to the last version. The update on the PC sucks too, but at least you can still access it there through file explorer, which is great.",1,com.dropbox.android
S. Jaye,"There's no way to download folders, only files. If I want to download a folder containing an artist's mp3s, with each album in its own folder, I have to download the individual songs and recreate the folders on my device. Infuriating. Edit: I can't actually download anything. The app says that the files have downloaded, but none of it can be found on my phone. I'm downgrading my rating to one star.",1,com.dropbox.android
Mark Sherman,"I have been a thrilled user of Dropbox for years. But now, only 3 linked devices with free plan. I guess they need to make more money. Goodbye Dropbox! Edit: I should add that the entry level option past free is $10/month for 1TB which is way beyond my needs. I really only used Dropbox for sharing a few files among two desktops, a laptop, a phone, and a tablet. Once in a while I used it to share photos with friends. Offer a cheaper option and maybe I will come back.",1,com.dropbox.android
Christian Avelallemant,"Works fine on iOS. Can download files/folders, move files around within folders and my app will automatically fix the problem within my folder. On Android, this app is a piece of garbage. I'm a paying customer like many others and all I see is the same problem: 'storage full or unavailable' when I try to access my files. I can't even view them! Much less download them. I'm an artist and dropbox has always been my cloud service of choice, but if this bug isn't fixed I'll have to reconsider.",1,com.dropbox.android
Mike Jarecke,"So. Dropbox raises their price above the competition. Yet, for almost 3 years. Yes. 3. They have not fixed a BIG bug with backup. If your roming. Your out of luck with Dropbox. They won't listen or fix the problem. They just don't get it. I have been using them 8 years. I suggest to everyone to change to Google. It's cheaper and does not have a bug issue with camera uploads.",1,com.dropbox.android
A Google user,"Can't figure it out. Can't get downloads off line. Takes forever and repeatedly ""fails"". It is automatically opening this and saving them to Dropbox when that is not where I want it to go. Have spent hours trying to figure out how to change permissions but nothing works. Also very complex to uninstall... multiple places to seek out on computer to get rid of it. Maybe I'm just daft, but it is way beyond me and not user friendly from my view point. Baffeling ‚òπÔ∏è",1,com.dropbox.android
Ragan Jones,"Not so excited anymore. I've been using Dropbox for about 6 years to backup pics from my phone. I had earned additional storage space to the point of having 8GBs available to me. Lately, I've been having issues with my files and pictures staying synched between devices. Instead of being able to file my pics and documents away, I write this while I wait for my past week's images to be available to me. I'm off to research other services while I wait for synching to complete.",1,com.dropbox.android
Mr. Guapo,"Signed up for the 30 free trial.  Meh.  Tried to cancel the next day, but there was no button for that in Dropbox.  I had to search for it, and discovered that I had to go to My Subscriptions in Google Play, but COULDN'T.  There's nothing there regarding Dropbox.  Now I'm having a hard time finding the Contact Us link.    Don't sign up for this nuisance.",1,com.dropbox.android
Springer Ranch,"mediocre with untapped potential. It needs to sync files but only allows you online access, defeating it's purpose. It also doesn't register a micro sd card, only allowing for internal device storage. The app only previews files as well, so you have to download the file to preview it, then download again to actually open the file. The desktop app is fantastic, but the mobile version is nearly useless.",1,com.dropbox.android
Chi Seemyown,Y'all trippin... This don't make no sense Been using Dropbox reliably and without fail for YEARS...Now all of a sudden Dropbox won't connect even though I've got data and WiFi internet access. Signing out and in again didn't work and if this uninstall to reinstall doesn't fix the problem that's a wrap for this app. It don't matter to me if it works as it's supposed to on my laptop when I can't access my stuff when on my cell. That completely defeats the purpose. FIX THIS!!!!!,1,com.dropbox.android
Michael Bryson,"Tried to test Dropbox out for sharing information in a project with others. I have to verify my email account to get things started, problem is they never send me a verification email. Not in inbox, not in spam/junk mail. Tried too many times. Googled it and it looks like it is a huge issue that can't be easily resolved. I gave up on it.",1,com.dropbox.android
Eric Rose,"It is amazing to me that Dropbox hasn't figured out that their thumbnails are so small that you can't tell what you are looking at. Managing photos in Dropbox is impossible, slow and tedious. We had to move 120,000 images to Google photos so we could actually find images without having to open them just to see what we couldn't see in the thumbnail.",1,com.dropbox.android
George Abraham,I am a paid subscriber but have constant issues with Dropbox. The interface is just not intuitive. You can't restore files from within the app--you need to open your web browser. Simple prompts to overwrite files are non existent: you need to go into a file manager and delete the file first. Support is so horrible to deal with you end up just living with it's many flaws. Sure wish someone at Dropbox actually took a look at their user experience. You figured it get better as a subscriber but it's not.,1,com.dropbox.android
timtom,Horrendous application routinely fails at backing up my cell phone pics. That's the only thing I ask Dropbox to do. It does work for a while then it randomly stops backing up for no apparent reason. And you have no idea that it has decided to stop..... you think your photos are being protected but they are not. NEXT!!!,1,com.dropbox.android
Alto Octave,"I changed phones and phone services recently. Dropbox doesn't work as it did in my old phone, with the emphasis on ""doesn't work"". Where are my files? They were always accessible on my old phone. I haven't a clue how to access them. I can use the browser to access them, I guess, but then why bother to have the app? Really annoying.‚òπÔ∏è",1,com.dropbox.android
Brianna Novack,"Signed up for the 30 day free trial, wanted to cancel after a week. It was super hard to figure out how to cancel but finally found it after 30 min of searching around and thought it was done. Nope, they are still charging me 9.99 a month. I cancelled it two more times and now I just got another email saying they charged me again. I'm really annoyed with this app. Don't download!",1,com.dropbox.android
J K,"Dropbox FORCES you to use this app version on your mobile device, when you'd prefer to the actual site, then severely limits what you can do with the files via the app. ""Want to hear an MP3 that someone shared with you? Sorry you cant do that on the app."" Why? What's the point? Thanks for choosing to make life more difficult for your users, Dropbox.",1,com.dropbox.android
L,"I love this concept and Dropbox in general. the problem is: this app FREAKIN SUCKS! Dropbox works great from a laptop or desktop computer. But from a cellphone it blows! I have the settings arranged so that it's SUPPOSED to upload pics (or docs) on demand, whether I'm connected to Wi-Fi or not. And although I do use Battery-Saver on my android (S9 Plus), I have an exception for this app, to be exempt. So it should upload stuff instantly. But half the time it does not. waits for days sometimes! üò°",1,com.dropbox.android
Michael Roe,How far the mighty have fallen! What was once a dependable go-to for promptly backing up the photos and videos from my phone has now become a complete joke. The sleeping giant no longer auto-uploads no matter what setting I use. Now I have to go in manually & hand choose all the photos and videos I want backed up and then set my screen to stay on for 10 minutes or it will stop uploading. It's bad enough to make me want to go back to Hightail. What a waste!,1,com.dropbox.android
Brett Buonamici,"was a useful app until they took what had been a free feature for like 10 years and turned it into something you need to pay for. they only allow you to connect to 3 devices, more than that you have to pay. but with two laptops, tablets and phones it was great because you have access to all your files from every device but now you dont. I just moved all files to onedrive, bye bye dropbox. charge for something google, box, onedrive, etc all do for free? stupid",1,com.dropbox.android
Leland Goodman,"I've been using Dropbox for many years and it's true, the user experience has been going steeply downhill for a while now. I already pay for the service but the app constantly continues to ask for me to upgrade. Why is saving photos so convoluted? PLEASE just make it so I can open up a photo, long-press it and have that pop up a ""save to device"" option.",1,com.dropbox.android
WM McCall,"Dropbox changed agreement to three devices only, but said you can keep it installed on existing devices.  I replaced my phone with a new one and tried to install Dropbox on it.  You might think, so what, just uninstall it from the old phone then install it on the new.  But no, you have to uninstall it from all other devices to get down to the three device limit.  Works for me, until I find another app, even if I have to pay for the new one.",1,com.dropbox.android
Michael Ratner,"Dropbox lives off their past fame. They haven't been doing anything good for a while, and it only gets worse. The cumbersome interface and limited functionality are still the same as years ago. The features that nobody needs (like Paper) are being pushed in your face. Just compare with Google One -- clean, efficient, and very affordable. Today I cancelled my ridiculously expensive 2TB plan I had for many many years (but didn't really use) - no refund for the remaining 10 months. Never again!",1,com.dropbox.android
KristinaAllure,"Can't upload any files from anywhere anymore. Every single time I try to, I get an error message that says ""file can not be uploaded due to security risks"" even though I have nothing turned on in my settings or Dropbox options that would cause this. I'm far from the only one having this same issue and telling everyone to download your beta version is NOT helpful. I want to upload files to your FILE STORAGE app that I pay a ridiculous amount for every month to work as it should.",1,com.dropbox.android
Dan Kennedy,"I received an email saying that I hadn't used Dropbox for a while and should look into it. When I clicked on the link provided, I was given the choice to download the Android app. I did so, and was not allowed to do anything except to upgrade to the pro version via a 2 week trial. I looked at the conditions, noticed that I could cancel immediately if necessary, so in order to get into my supposed files, I subscribed. I had 0.0 out of 2.0 terabytes used. Cancelled.",1,com.dropbox.android
Mindstormsman,"Great service but the mobile app is basically useless, you can't download the files to use in other apps. As an example, music can't be opened in your media player, instead you have to open Dropbox then open the file in Dropbox to play it and it only plays that song. If you want to listen to an album while driving you have to go to the Dropbox website and download it from there so they actually save to the device's file system and can be accessed by you other apps.",1,com.dropbox.android
Justin Van Houten,"I've used drop box for years, I only use it to share a few pdf files with my business partners. It works great for that. What I hate is that I have been upgraded twice now, without wanting an upgrade, and it has been very difficult to get refunds. They make it tricky when opening the app on new devices.",1,com.dropbox.android
Gregory Lella,"You people are more concerned with giving me ads to upgrade than you are with making a reliable service. I stayed up until 3 am working on a lecture. I saved it, watched it synch, closed it, and the next morning when I got to work 40 minutes before class it was gone. I had to start over! I'm switching to Google Drive!",1,com.dropbox.android
Michael Wilkerson,"After recent update I am getting the following message when I click on files, ""Can't connect to Dropbox. Make sure you are online or try again"". Obviously I am online as I am writing this from the same device, the OnePlus 7t. I've never had any issues before the update and is quite irritating as I used this all the time. I have tried shutting down my Wi-Fi, try different Wi-Fi connections, no Wi-Fi using data only.no matter what I try it doesn't work and I continue to get the same message.",1,com.dropbox.android
Kareem Abdalla,"it'd be great if i dunno i could actually access my files. I've had Dropbox for years and let's be real here, the app is currently and always has been garbage. Don't take on storage as you're #1 task and then suck at it. Thumbnails sometimes load, files rarely load, no sophisticated organization of files, and ultimately no confidence in what the product claims to do. just trying to see an old picture requires an export to software that can actually handle it. and yes on good wifi. so sad",1,com.dropbox.android
Scott D,"Editor is SO BAD at context/ data loss, you have to ""save"" essentially every sentence. It would be bad enough if it merely crashed every time you switch over to another app for 5 seconds, but it will revert to home directory and drop your editor at random times (you will see the blue logo screen paint, followed by revert to home directory... For NO DAMN REASON). I have had irreplaceable data loss because of this and now use only Microsoft Onedrive, which has exhibited no such problems.",1,com.dropbox.android
iyg rsstj,Doesn't Open. I don't see the point of having this on my computer when I can't even get it open. Everything is updated and how it should be and yet this stupid app will never work. What's the point in having an app that can work on all platforms and claim that it works on all platforms when in truth it doesn't.... I feel like it's more of a Spybot on my computer as it has access to everything on my computer but yet ceases to actually let me view anything. Sketchy sketchy. -10 don't recommend.,1,com.dropbox.android
Jocelyn Booth,"Used to have no problems with this app... very easy to use... Not anymore. At the beginning of May I could select the folder I wanted to upload files from, now I am given a list of pictures by date only. I only upload specific pictures to drop box and this is not user friendly at all. I'm not searching through all the pictures I take when the ones I want to upload are all in one folder that I can't get to. Please fix this horrible feature",1,com.dropbox.android
James Panzica,"Was working fine with auto uploads from my laptop. Then last week (Aug 16) Windows updated latest version of Windows 10. Now Dropbox no longer works. Have deleted, then reinstalled, etc. No icon on screen, no auto uploads, nothing. Have had to discontinue using it. Luckily, almost everything I had on it was still on my hard drive.

Zell Curry,They make it very hard to get your property back. You can download pictures by clickicking on every single one. You can click on the double check and mark them all. But if you have over 1000 pictures you must uncheck them one by one. They wont let you download folders. I cant find any groups to download in chunks. My dropbox has been filled for a long time but im not going to click 1000 pictures twice then select all.,1,com.dropbox.android
Gilberto Martinez Jr.,"I'm done with google. I'm starting with google photos. Dropbox came to mind first, so I downloaded it, installed it, and uploaded around 20 photos to start, so as not to overload it and have it get stuck, the way it does with google. Uploaded fast, made 4 albums and placed photos where I wanted them. So my question is, where are my albums? Details on photos has album name but no albums. If you want people to use your product make sure it works. Problems in the first 5 mins? Really? Not good...",1,com.dropbox.android
Katherine Knowles,"I signed up for a Dropbox account out of desperation when I was buying a new phone unexpectedly and hadn‚Äôt backed up any of my photos.  Things were fine for a while, until I was forced to purchase a Dropbox Plus account, which I did not want. I deleted my Dropbox account shortly after that, and for three months, I was still getting billed for a subscription that I did not have anymore. Reaching out to customer service was incredibly difficult, and when a man named Ron did finally email me back, he asked for a lot of credit card information that I was not comfortable giving out. I shortly after got an email that my subscription had been renewed and I had not given ANY CONSENT to activate or renew any subscription I once had.  I got curious and downloaded the Dropbox app to my phone, and when I tried to sign in, it showed no account with their service for my email address. I decided to go through my bank instead and placed a stop payment on any payments that they try to take out of my account in the future. I will be taking further action to receive a refund for the months that they billed me for unethically, and I do not recommend this service to anyone.",1,com.dropbox.android
Chad Hosey,"Dropbox used to be such a great app. Now its impossible to share photos, download them to a place where you can share them,etc. I just spent an hour trying to send a photo from my Dropbox in a text to wish a friend happy birthday. No matter how many times you download it, it goes to NOWHERE you can access it to use in a text or Facebook messenger message. You can only send it in a horribly cropped version that advertises Dropbox, forcing the recipient to go to their page to view it. Garbage.",1,com.dropbox.android

I only downloaded this app because I was desperate since Shoebox closed. Shoebox was free and waaay better than Drop box. I don't even use Drop box, too complicated, and yet you took $30 or more from my bank account. I want my money back. If I could give this app zero stars I would. Very frustrating and confusing app.",1,com.dropbox.android

I design watch faces for an app... and host the .watch files for download and now..... your app says it doesn't have the permission to read the file.

A Google user,Worst app I ever used. It is really inconvenient. I want to save a few hundred pictures to my phone yet I can only select 1 at a time. jeez. I need to select all and save to phone. also I need to upload albums to dropbox. I do not need to spend 3 days selecting 1 picture at a time. I have 15 albums with 1000 pictures in each one. No dropbox wants to only let you select todays pictures. this makes organization my pictures impossible,1,com.dropbox.android
Anna Maxfield,"I would use this app more if it didn't crash half a second after I opened it, every time I opened it. I have sent the feedback logs in when prompted more times than I can count. If this service didn't have all the photos of my sisters wedding stored on it, I'd cancel my subscription. As it is, I'm paying for a service I can't use, to keep pictures I can't access. TLDR; App won't open. 1/10. Would not recommend this app.",1,com.dropbox.android
Will Padgett,"Frustrating and costly. Im out $120+ for a broken app. I've always preferred Google Drive, but decided to try Dropbox because my coworkers were using it for gigs to share music and charts. I opted for the Plus free trial. When I'm forced to use Dropbox, I remember that, this 'Pro' thing I opted into at $10/month, does. Not. Work. i tap 'Upgrade' from the app/browser, the app says I have already been upgraded. No way to cancel from the app or website. Scam. Finally cancelled from Subscriptions",1,com.dropbox.android

Max Wilke,"Dropbox used to be a simple, reliable service to keep extra files and photos. Now it's INCREDIBLY annoying to view photos on the app because several popups to ""comment"" ""copy a link"" or ""share"" a photo come up EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU TRY VIEWING A PHOTO. If I wanted to do any of those options, I'd just access those options on the side of the photo before opening it.

And no way of getting it back, will be moving my whole family away from dropbox.",1,com.dropbox.android
Bob Marois,"Took an app that did work really well for many years and messed it up. They make it hard to get your pictures off their cloud, keeps reloading the same pictures over when you finally do delete what you have in an effort to get you to pay a ridiculous price for more storage.

Now trying to delete so they quit bugging me to pay 11.99 a month as I do, Dropbox puts them back on!",1,com.dropbox.android
Bob Zavala,"I thought Drop Box would be the answer to the many photos I take of our local high schools sports. There was a lot of trouble trying to use the link by many of my supporters.

Recently dropbox limited the number of devices that can be linked to the dropbox service without paying for a premium tier account. because of this, dropbox is now overall useless to me.

I get half saved and then an error that files didn't upload, so then you have to go and manually find everything that didn't upload which takes an extremely long time. It's also to hard to do it from the app since you can't search through your photos by album on your phone. It's almost impossible to get everything saved :(",1,com.dropbox.android

I do not see this ever getting reverted. Yes, I was using the free account. This change has limited the app's usefulness for me. Time has come to look for storage elsewhere.",1,com.dropbox.android

It takes long enough to put things up without adding extra hoops to jump through first, so I'm going to uninstall this app.",2,com.dropbox.android
David Marshall,"Dropbox app lost key scanning features. When I upgraded from the Galaxy S7 to S10, I found the new Dropbox app has poor scanning ability due to the loss of manual focusing and use of the flash. When I used the old version on the S7, I was able to save quality scans of any document, even in the dark. The PDF documents that the new version creates are blurry even when there is ample light. Dropbox, please bring back the manual focus and flash features. I depend on this app for work.",2,com.dropbox.android

Kevin Scott,"The single most important utility of dropbox - transferring files from one decive to another - has been made as deliberately hard as possible. You'd think you could download your own files from your own drop box account to your own phone, but clicking download places files in a hidden temp folder. Delete them from dropbox, and it deletes those files (learned that the hard way). Also, they withhold the ability to download a whole folder at a time.

Matt McRobbie,"Why does Dropbox always give a little, but takes so much back with each update? I use Dropbox to share music with collaborators - I'd prefer not to, but they want to use Dropbox. The latest upgrade now has an embedded player, and it's now easier to share files - so finally after years of the Dropbox app telling me there was no way to open an MP3 file, now there is - but the player can't be backgrounded - how utterly annoying. You need to keep the screen alive to listen to the MP3. There is an option to open the file in Youtube Music - with apparently the option to 'always use this app' - but typical Dropbox, that doesn't work. I'm really unimpressed, this would seem like an obvious feature, you basically can't use your phone for anything else while you are listening to a sound file. Lame. Really lame.

If I select files to move 99% of the time it takes me more than 5 minutes to do so, especially if it's several files. For years I've been getting ""cannot transfer now, cannot connect to the Internet""....I'm NOT offline! I've waited a couple of years for a fix, but it has never come. I'm always afraid I'm going to lose some pics because I think they've transferred and they haven't. Time to look for another option",3,com.dropbox.android

I guess not. I'm very disappointed.",3,com.dropbox.android

Josh Rhine,"Great service with one MAJOR flaw. I tried business for free, decided I didn't want it, so I didn't renew the subscription. Dropbox now is forcing me to either renew my subscription or be stuck with a permanent notification that CANNOT be swiped away. If you click it you get a screen that says renew or cancel.

Dropbox support IS trying to help but now wants access to my whole disk = a privacy problem. BEWARE: Without your knowledge, understanding or permission, their Sync capability completely alters your disk structure by moving everything into a hidden folder and then aliasing everything. Disaster recovery is NOT assured.",4,com.dropbox.android
Kate T.,"Dropbox has always been great and innovative. The only thing I long for is Markdown support with basic syntax coloring in doc editing. I've been able to drop Google Docs with my writing and just edit files in Dropbox itself, which I order, but I don't have a means of visually seeing my styling. It's not a big deal, and I really don't want full Wysiwyg support, but a little extra something here would be nice.",4,com.dropbox.android
Isydia Vibes,"Good app and excellent service. If I would comment on the app features it would be to allow users to choose the directory when uploading and not show all images or docs to choose from.

Nathan Holth,Works well overall but you have to refresh literally any folder you open to show changes for example I just opened a folder where I expected to see a folder I added via Desktop over a month ago and it did not show on the Android app until I swiped to refresh the folder.

In fact, epub files that opened previously then stopped opening. On edit: took the dev advice and got a lightweight epub reader which works alongside dropbox.

Rasmus Sch√∏ler S√∏rensen,"When using ‚ÄùShare -> Add to Dropbox‚Äù feature, the app doesn't have any visual cues about how to navigate the folder tree. You have to use the back button to go up the folder tree. Which is pretty unintuitive given that on Android, the back button usually means ‚ÄùGo back to the previous view‚Äù (like a browser's back button), and since this is the first view, going back would go back to the app I came from. Just add a button with an up-arrow icon.",4,com.dropbox.android

The other flaw is that it do not allow me transfer more than 8 files at a time. This kills my time. Otherwise it's a good app. ‚ô•",4,com.dropbox.android

I would rather use this as storage. Had no problems so far. Free storage and as usual the same as most clouds, has options to pay for more storage",5,com.dropbox.android
Clement Panao,Very reliable as it serves its purpose using it on my web. And as a begginer it was easy to navigate through the required task I needed to complete. An excellent app to use doing business.,5,com.dropbox.android

Chris Iapetus,"After getting used to Google Drive & Microsoft OneDrive for the past couple of years, a bored-Sunday-afternoon Dropbox trial was the good kind of bombshell. The interface is very intuitive, attractive, & offers a slate of options & features not seen in their big bruiser competition, or at least not so easy to access that I'm aware of their existence. I'm gonna have a righteous go at using this surprisingly slick & powerful system for a while & see where that takes us. Good job, Dropbox folks !!",5,com.dropbox.android

MaxiiKK,"Great overall but needs folder autosync that will sync files and not just pictures, i dont really understand whats so hard about it if you already support camera auto upload. Auto syncing documents will help people not lose important documents. Dropbox is the most reliable cloud storage service for storing anything important without ever losing anything but it needs more affordable plans and not just one with too much storage for the majority of users.",5,com.dropbox.android

Although the storage is only 2GB, which is insufficient for our day and age; the performance is highly compensating for it. The upgrades are convenient in case you need more space.

Its literally just expanded storage.",5,com.dropbox.android
Bryn Barker,"So far so good. Considering the mediocre mobile apps for Google Drive and OneDrive, this Dropbox app is a welcome departure.

Philip Kapadia,The Ui needs to be updated to match the new mediafire look. I'd also like to be able to see the upload progress when I upload a file via the mobile app. Downloading multiple files at once shouldn't be a premium feature!

Ponam Madam,"It's a great file sharing and hosting app, Good for creating backups also but ... You know that the UI (User Interface) and GUI (Graphical User Interface) needs to be updated and a bit more easy to use. The UI looks to old Looks like I'm running it on a very old phone..

Mars Hottentot,"Doing this to get app dev attention. I've been a paying customer of MediaFire for over ten years so, yes, I love it. This app, however? It kinda doesn't work for Android os11. As in - it will not upload anything over a few MBs. Crashes every time. I end up using the browser version which kinda makes the app redundant. I basically only use it to quick check on items in my account. Anyway - let's make this app functional? 12/16/21 - App has ceased to function. Cannot authenticate account.

Recommended for new user but I am not sure how much storage you will be given for free basic account. If the rate is better than its competitor I might buy more storage.,4,com.mediafire.android

Kyle Armstrong,"The problems with this is almost funny. It is actually way more simple to download through a web browser. It says it's faster downloads, but it doesn't affect it enough to really matter. The only thing it actually does for me is download. Every time I press the install option, it does absolutely nothing; pointless to use an app that does only half of what it is meant to be used for. It's way better to just not use this waste of space on phone storage and use the website instead.",1,mega.privacy.android.app
Timothy Hamilton,"I subscribed to the 1 Tb Premium plan for 2 years. Mega.nz will not load in either Chrome or FIrefox. That has persisted for months. The Andoid app is slow when it does work. Disappointing experience overall. My subscription is up in January and already canceled. All I wanted was something that could keep files synced between my desktop & laptop. Nothing too difficcult, i thought. Being able to occasionally share files/directories was a plus. But it can't even do that. My overall recommendation is don't bother, and don't use it for anything important.",1,mega.privacy.android.app
Buddy Kukahiko,"I enjoyed the app very much when I was using the free version. I exceeded the storage limit and was told my data would be deleted if I didn't upgrade. My account got locked so I couldn't download or delete to make space; I had to pay to not lose my files. Now, I can't download any of them. They say they have finished, but when I looked where I save them to, the new files don't show up. They also don't show up in my recent downloads folder on my phone. I paid to upgrade, not downgrade. Please fix",1,mega.privacy.android.app
John Doe,"This app is total garbage.

Anastasia Cattahocce,"I've had Mega for a few months. It's pretty easy to upload files, but don't ever plan on using them again. I can view the files in Mega, but I cannot access them to attach or edit, or anything else. It makes the storage pointless. I could not get the app on my PC, once again limiting any functionality. I contacted support and over a week has passed without any response. This was a terrible waste of my time and now I can't use the files I uploaded to this cloud, which is unacceptable.",1,mega.privacy.android.app

Robert Keating,"You don't need this. I downloaded it because I thought it could store compressed .apk files so I could then launch them and only have the expanded version on my phone. It would have saved a lot of phone memory. But it wouldn't let me open them. Also, it started copying my photos EVEN THOUGH I TOLD IT NOT TO!!

Repeated attempts, uninstall reinstall reset computer, nothing. Tried straight browser upload. Synced more but chaos in the cloud directory. Not as organized as original directory. Did not sync all either. Only small fraction. Horrific design. I have huge phone and barely anything fits on screen. Massive amount empty space",1,mega.privacy.android.app
Baptiste Guillory,Used to love this app but with recent updates it has become incredibly problematic. I have no use for the storage I just use it for downloading because it was stable compared to other options. But lately I'll try reaching a download only to get stuck in an infinity loading screen loop. And often after finishing a download it may restart from 0%. Maybe it's the phone? I upgraded from an S8 to an S20 FE 5G. Connectivity shouldn't be an issue though I'm running high 200mb/s. I dunno.,1,mega.privacy.android.app
John Galt,"Totally useless. It doesn't remember your download between reboots. If for some reason the (cr)app closes it forgets your download and you have to start over from scratch. Even though i can see the file in a file explorer. If i restart the download, pause, copy the previous download on to the current, restart the download. It doesnt recognize the change in file size and continues to download the first part of the file. MEGA needs a useful CLI program that actually works with new accounts.",1,mega.privacy.android.app
Tala Farals,"WOW this app sucks. It's slow, there's no way to manually refresh the file listing without having to log off and log back in, FORGET adding people to shared folders: It's just broken, and no one developing this app seems to care.

User,"2nd review...Mega Sucks. App sucks. Website sucks. Videos take forever to download and play. Cant rewind or go forward. Thumbnails are tinny tiny and almost impossible to see. Cant scroll through a folder or list.

Marky Mark,"Although I generally love Mega, their app is quite fraudulent, or at the very least, deceiving in my experience. I was unable to sign up for a month of premium on their website - after several attemlts with various well known credit cards - so i was forced to dowoad the app, and add in my payment info this way. I do not remember seeing an option to cancel recurring payment, such as on their website. So, I figured it would just charge my card for that one month. I was wrong.",1,mega.privacy.android.app

Philip Chaplin,They say there's free ways to raise your downloads/transfers. It's wierd how you can run out of your transfer limit but not download space. There's minimal info on how to use the app. If you download a file to your device & delete it in the app to free up space it also deletes the file you just downloaded. You'd think that once it's on your device the files wouldn't be connected anymore but you'd be wrong.

My friend has recently shared (full access) few videos of his bitrhday some 5-10 videos. But when i play his video it always opens the first video only everytime. I never was able to view his other videos. Please fix this issue soon. This is noticed only on mega android app. On chrome mega extension it works properly. Hope this issue is fixed in future updates.,4,mega.privacy.android.app
Jake McCoy,They aren't kidding when they warn you not to lose your password. I forgot mine and there's absolutely no way to retrieve it. So if you need to permanently stash some files that nobody will find if you suddenly drop dead? This is your app. Unfortunately I stored tons of business files on my account and picked a random password that I thought I'd remember. Nope.,4,mega.privacy.android.app

Munir Al Huraibi,excellent but it doesn't integrate well with office mobile-suite,4,mega.privacy.android.app
Abubakar Sani,I think it's the best and the reason I didn't give it 5 star is because of transfer quota exceeded.,4,mega.privacy.android.app

Jody Martin,"Fantastic storage app, one of the best I have found with adequate free storage. The only reason I give 4 stars is that the upgrade levels require monthly subscription, if it were a one payment for each level (I would be willing to pay as much as ¬£20) and I would be happy to upgrade and certainly give 5 stars.",4,mega.privacy.android.app
1704102 Tahsin Ahmed,"there are some serious issues with notification. most of the time i dont get the notifications of messages from the mega chat. i have to manually open the app to see if there are any messages, messages dont pop up in the notification bar even while connected  to internet. and it almost never gives any notification either when i get re-connected to the internet after turning the data / wifi off.",4,mega.privacy.android.app
Prathamesh Walse,You guys have done a great work. Downloads are working smoothly now. I am changing the rating to 4 stars. It's really good that developers are listening and working on it. Fix it or else everyone will eventually stop using it and will loose credibility. There is serious problem when downloading big files using the App. I have lost lots of data as file keeps downloading and never gets downloaded. Please fix it. It's extremely annoying and performs worst among other downloading apps and platforms.,4,mega.privacy.android.app
Usman Shah,"Really like your app, very helpful. But I have this one issue even when download is done and I close the app, I can't get rid of the completed download notification from my notification bar, how do I get rid of it?",4,mega.privacy.android.app

Queen Anna,easy to use. it does get a bit glitchy though and has been freezing up and not responding on occasion I would give it 5 stars if it gets fixed,4,mega.privacy.android.app
Rana M.Moazzam Khan,This app is great. Easy to use and user friendly. but the storage issue is always there only 3GB of data is allowed to store.,4,mega.privacy.android.app
Richard Burkhill,"It is very good for storing data but not so good for retrieving data, data could be grouped into smaller packages and download rates optimized",4,mega.privacy.android.app
CleverBiGuy,fantastic app! I've been using this for several years and always enjoyed the service. Only one issue I've seen and that is randomly something causes the app to freeze soon after opening the app. Still haven't quite figured out the root issue whether its on the device or the app itself. But it occurs on different devices.,5,mega.privacy.android.app
Patrick Lambert,Great cloud service. If you want to use a cloud service this is probably what you want. The app is alright. Some notes on the app. *Sometimes if you upload a lot of files (hundreds or more) at once the app will crash or freeze. *If you stream a video it won't be in fullscreen (and no setting for it) *On a samsung phone you can bypass the pin lock by opening the app with dex.,5,mega.privacy.android.app
Adam,"It is not the best thing out there by any means but .... cloud storage that has true end to end storage on the consumer market are not that good. Especially if want one that works across all platforms; phone, tablet, computer, etc. Mega has Win, Mac, iOS, Android, etc. and even has clients for Linux and others with low market share. Big Tech cloud services are much easier but no privacy. Some smaller providers are better but only offer server side encryption so you still do not control data, a government order or even disgruntled employee with access to the keys could access your data. Other options like Nextcloud require you to configure the encryption. There are others out there but they either; require more than one app, only cover certain platforms, not user friendly at all, much more expensive, or only feasible if scaled for enterprise. Mega should be more like a 3 but due to competition in the field, it is a 5.",5,mega.privacy.android.app
Wicked,"The best clod storage app! Use this yo upload music files since it doesn't Compress it like google drive! My only problem is that it deletes everything if you don't log into it after a certain period of time. So if you using this to archive stuff for other people to download for years and years to come, you better log in once every few months. If you don't want to do that, then try something else like dropbox",5,mega.privacy.android.app
Evan Luke Mentzer,"This is a great alternative or additional PDF reader, much like Adobe Acrobat. I use them both so I can divide up my library of files. Also, I don't know if it matters at all, but I like to use the program that the peer I download a file from is using to store/send the file to me with. I hope that sentence made sense cause I ain't goin back an fixin it.",5,mega.privacy.android.app
Jem Walker,"I love the Mega platform, but this app is slow and unstable to the point of barely being usable. Crashes frequently and lags for minutes at a time. Edit: this was essentially a problem with how I'd set up the sync - inadvertently had thousands of files in the root directory! Fixed now and the app runs much more smoothly.",5,mega.privacy.android.app
Potato Pineapples,"Perfect for saving videos and audio. Though this is a bit of a ""first world problem"" request, it would be nice to have a speed option on videos and audio. It gets sometimes irritating that I have to constantly download and then upload them when dealing with speed issues. Other than that, very nice app. I prefer it more than the desktop one for it's simplicity.",5,mega.privacy.android.app
Laney Lush,"I love this app SO MUCH! You get tons more free cloud storage than you do with dropbox, and they give you bonus free storage for adding new contacts, even if they're already MEGA users. My job involves sharing a lot of media files, usually between 1 and 3 GB each, oftwn with multiple people at once. MEGA not only makes it possible, it lets me do it so quickly and easily that it has saved me so much time and stress since I signed up and I recommend it to everyone I know!",5,mega.privacy.android.app
Matt Staszak,"Best, free cloud app on the market. Good 50 gb space for no cost. Excellent interface. Been using it for almost 2 years now. I'd highly recommend it. App doesn't seem to even work anymore. It worked just fine the day before, but then it suddenly stopped being able to upload or download anything to or from my cloud storage. Edit: Update fixed the issue.",5,mega.privacy.android.app
Renjee Gallohill,"I absolutely think Mega is the best cloud service by far. Not only do they offer a very secure encrypted cloud service but they also offer features most people are unaware of. Like the direct message in between Mega users. This feature allows you to send messages directly to other users with the ability to attach media and other files. You also can voice call other users and/or video call. You are given a generous amount of storage space at 50GB. Thanks Mega, Highly recommend to anyone!",5,mega.privacy.android.app
nyconsult410,"Excellent Service, Great Pricing, and packed with features and Extras, plus top notch security! They even have text, talk, and video conferencing that I have ever used ... the clarity of video and sound is outstanding!

Shane Britton,"The best secure cloud storage app available for Android: intuitive UI; streamlined menu options; ease of access, and an aesthetically appealing interface. Moreover, the dev rolls out regular updates to MEGA for added features, stability improvements, and bug fixes. Hats off to the dev. Five stars...",5,mega.privacy.android.app
Matt Sinclair,Very impressed !! MEGA had changed a lot since i last used it. Upload speeds are excellent and being able to upload folders is a huge win. Definitely the best cloud service I've used so far. People giving negative reviews are obviously blaming MEGA when its their device or internet connection that is the problem.,5,mega.privacy.android.app
Neil,Been using it for weeks without problems. I really appreciate the free storage. Hopefully mega is around for a long time and I'll upgrade one day. Gdrive isn't even an option as they do not offer the clientside encryption mega does.,5,mega.privacy.android.app
Jan Kowalski,"Finally, a fully functioning, simple to use & share, private & secure app. I have been using it daily for months now for storage, file sharing, and all forms of electronic communication other than e-mail.

I've had so many stressful weeks with other half-assed updates form other cloud providers I wonder how come this app keeps hitting it out of the park and stays free?

Para Yfory,I have a feeling that google don't want me to install this app because it was harder to search for (compare to past experiences) Everything is great (and definitely better than google drive which you can't even upload a whole folder on android) Though it would be great if there are thumbnails on folder as an option to help with navigating video and photos.,5,mega.privacy.android.app
